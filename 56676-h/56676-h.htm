<small>GODFREY EVANS.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;WAL, of all the dinners that ever a white man
sot down to, this yere is the beat!&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker was Godfrey Evans&mdash;a tall, raw-boned
man, dressed in a tattered, brown jean suit.
He was barefooted, his toil-hardened hands and
weather-beaten face were sadly soiled and begrimed,
and his hair and whiskers looked as though they had
never been made acquainted with a comb. As he
spoke he drew an empty nail-keg from its corner,
placed a board over the top of it, and seating himself,
ran his eye over the slender stock of viands his
wife had just placed on the table.</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s appearance was in strict keeping with
his surroundings. The cabin in which he lived and
everything it contained told of the most abject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
poverty. The building, which was made of rough,
unhewn logs, could boast of but one room and a loft,
to which access was gained by a ladder fastened
against the wall. It had no floor and no windows,
all the light being admitted through a dilapidated
door, which every gust of wind threatened to shake
from its hinges, and the warmth being supplied by
an immense fire-place with a stick chimney, which
occupied nearly the whole of one end of the cabin.
There were no chairs to be seen&mdash;the places of these
useful articles being supplied by empty nail-kegs and
blocks of wood; and neither were there any beds&mdash;a
miserable &#8220;shake-down&#8221; in one corner being the
best in this line that the cabin could afford. Everything
looked as if it were about to fall to pieces. Even
the rough board table on which the dinner was placed
would have tumbled over, had it not been propped
up against the wall.</p>

<p>Godfrey Evans had seen better days. He had
once been comparatively well off in the world; but
he had lost all his property through no fault of his
own, and the loss so disheartened him that he would
make no effort to accumulate more. At his time of
life it was too late to begin again with empty hands,
he said; so he accepted the situation, but with a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
bad grace, and spent the most of his time in roaming
about the woods with his gun on his shoulder, and
the rest in bemoaning his altered circumstances, and
denouncing those of his neighbors who were more
fortunate than himself.</p>

<p>Godfrey&#8217;s family consisted of a wife and two sons&mdash;the
latter aged respectively seventeen and fifteen
years. His wife was a meek-faced woman who had
seen a world of care and trouble, and who, while
submitting patiently to her hard lot, hoped for better
things, and placed unbounded confidence in her
youngest son, David, who was animated by an energetic,
manly spirit, which contrasted strangely with
his father&#8217;s indolence and indifference. Godfrey
seemed content to pass the remainder of his days in
that hovel, destitute of all the comforts, and even
suffering for many of the necessaries of life; but
David was not. He had high aspirations, had formed
plans, and, better than that, he had perseverance and
pluck enough to carry them out. Of him and his
brother, Daniel, we shall have more to say as our
story progresses. It will be enough, now, to tell the
reader that if they had been utter strangers, they
could not have been more unlike each other. David
was of a lively, cheerful disposition, and his entry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
into the comfortless hovel he called home, was like a
ray of sunshine bursting through a storm cloud.
Daniel, on the other hand, was like his father, morose
and sullen, and when he came home from the woods
or the steamboat landing, where he spent the most of
his time, it seemed as if a thunder cloud had suddenly
settled down over the cabin.</p>

<p>Having drawn his nail-keg up to the table, Godfrey
thrust his hand into his pocket, pulled out his jack-knife,
and picking up the fork that lay beside his
broken plate, held the two close together and looked
at them intently for several minutes. The fork was
not such a fork as the most of us use at our meals.
It was simply a piece of cane sharpened at one end;
and perhaps this story will fall into the hands of some
who can remember, or who have heard it said, that
there was a time, not so very long ago, when a good
many families in the South, who had all their lives
been accustomed to something better, had their choice
between employing their fingers at table, or using
such an implement as this we have just described.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at this yere, now,&#8221; said Godfrey, &#8220;jest
look at it, I say, the hul on yer, an&#8217; then ax yerselves
if it aint a purty pass fur a man to come to, who had
a nice house, a fine plantation and four niggers of his
own, only twelve short years ago! Eh?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>&#8220;We can&#8217;t help it, father,&#8221; said Mrs. Evans, who
knew that her angry husband expected her to say
something. &#8220;We had comforts once, and we might
have them now if&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, in course we might, if them Yanks had
stayed to hum, whar they belonged,&#8221; Godfrey almost
shouted. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t do nothin&#8217; to them that they
should come down here an&#8217; burn our houses an&#8217; cotton
gins, an&#8217; steal our things, did we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Federals didn&#8217;t do it all, father,&#8221; said David.
&#8220;They burned our buildings, just as they burned the
buildings of almost every man who was in the rebel
army; but we should have had enough left to get
along with, if Redburn&#8217;s guerillas had left us alone.
They didn&#8217;t leave us a bed to sleep on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what makes me so pizen savage agin everybody,&#8221;
exclaimed Godfrey, pounding with the handle
of his knife on the table. &#8220;The men what wore
the same colored jacket as I did, came here and tuk
what the Yanks left us. Why didn&#8217;t they go up to
Gordon&#8217;s an&#8217; clean them out too? Kase Gordon was
a gen&#8217;ral, that&#8217;s why. That fuss was a rich man&#8217;s
war, an&#8217; a poor man&#8217;s fight, that&#8217;s jest what that fuss
was; an&#8217; everybody can see it now that it is done past.
Men like me had to stay in the ranks an&#8217; carry a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
musket, an&#8217; starve an&#8217; freeze in the trenches&mdash;that&#8217;s
what we had to do; while rich planters, like Gordon,
lived high in their tents, rode their fine hosses, stole
the sanitary goods the Yanks sent to their fellers in
Richmond, an&#8217; thought they was a fightin&#8217; for the
&#8217;federacy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, father, General Gordon was wounded no
less than three times,&#8221; said David.</p>

<p>&#8220;S&#8217;pose he was,&#8221; replied Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; while he was fighting the Feds in front of
Richmond, some more of them came here and burned
down his splendid house, that ours wouldn&#8217;t have
made a woodshed to, and stole everything his family
had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they didn&#8217;t do nothing of the kind,&#8221; answered
his father, almost savagely. &#8220;They burned
his house, I know, an&#8217; sarved him right, too. I&#8217;m
glad of it; but as fur stealin&#8217; everything the Gordons
had, that ain&#8217;t so. No &#8217;taint. The gen&#8217;ral&#8217;s
got heaps an&#8217; stacks of money now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; said David, bluntly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want me to lay that cowhide over yer
shoulders right peart, you jest conspute me that ar
way onct more,&#8221; said Godfrey, setting down his cup
of buttermilk. &#8220;Whar did them speckled ponies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
come from that Don and Bert ride around the country,
I&#8217;d like to know, if the Gordons hain&#8217;t got no
money? I was up thar the other day when it rained
so hard, an&#8217; the gen&#8217;ral, bein&#8217; mighty perlite, axed
me would I come in an set till the storm was over.
Wal, I went, an&#8217; what did I see? The fust thing
I laid my eyes onto was a pianner that them gals
thumps on when they had oughter be workin&#8217; in the
kitchen. They was a settin&#8217; the table fur dinner,
too; an&#8217; didn&#8217;t I see silver forks thar, an&#8217; white-handled
knives, an&#8217; chiny, an&#8217; all them things that
would jest set me onto my feet agin if I had the
money they cost? I did, I bet ye. Hain&#8217;t got no
money, hey, the Gordons hain&#8217;t? I know better.
They have, an&#8217; that&#8217;s what makes me so pizen savage.
How have they got any more right to have to nor I
have? We both fit the Yanks, an&#8217; I made a poor
man of myself by it, while the gen&#8217;ral is jest as well
off as he ever was. Things ain&#8217;t fixed right in this
yere &#8217;arth, no how!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thar they come now,&#8221; said Dan, who sat where
he could look out of the door and up the road that
led toward General Gordon&#8217;s plantation. &#8220;Thar they
come, ridin&#8217; them circus-hosses, and talkin&#8217; an&#8217;
laughin&#8217; as though they was the happiest fellers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the world. Everybody is happy &#8217;ceptin&#8217; us. If I
had what one of them ponies is wuth, I wouldn&#8217;t
have to wear no sich clothes as these yere,&#8221; added
Dan, raising his arm and pulling his sleeve around so
that he could see the gaping rent in the elbow. &#8220;If
I could run one of them hosses off an&#8217; sell it without
being ketched, I&#8217;d do it to-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, Daniel, don&#8217;t talk so,&#8221; said his mother
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; why not, I&#8217;d like to know?&#8221; retorted Dan.
&#8220;Has them fellers any right to go a gollopin&#8217; about
the country on horseback, while I&#8217;ve got to hoof it
all the while, an&#8217; go barefoot too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they hain&#8217;t,&#8221; said Godfrey. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got
jest as much right to hoof it as any of us; an&#8217; we&#8217;ve
got the same right to ride on horseback that they
has. We could do it onct, an&#8217; we&#8217;ll do it agin! yes,
we will, fur times is goin&#8217; to change with us, an&#8217;
purty soon too. Now, don&#8217;t forget what I&#8217;m tellin&#8217;
ye; ye&#8217;ll see the eyes of the Gordons, an&#8217; all the
rest of the folks about here, a stickin&#8217; out as big as
<i>that</i>,&#8221; said Godfrey, flourishing his clenched hand
over the table. &#8220;As big as that, I say, an&#8217; afore
many days, too&mdash;p&#8217;rhaps next week!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whats goin&#8217; to happen, pop?&#8221; asked Dan.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>&#8220;Something that&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Godfrey glanced out at the door, and seeing that
the boys, whose approach had started the family on
this subject of conversation, were near at hand, put
on a very wise look and winked knowingly at his son,
who was obliged to restrain his curiosity for the
present.</p>

<p>We must stop here long enough to say a word concerning
the new-comers, as it is possible that we shall
often meet them hereafter. Their names were Donald
and Hubert Gordon, and they lived about a mile
from the cabin in which Godfrey Evans and his
family lived. And in what part of the world was
that? It doesn&#8217;t much matter, for as there is more
truth than fiction in some of the incidents we are
about to describe, we do not care to go too much into
details. It will be enough to say that the scene of
our story is laid, and that all the actors therein lived,
in one of our Southern States not very far from the
Mississippi river. As our tale progresses some attentive
reader, who has paid close attention to his
history, may be able to locate the exact spot.</p>

<p>Two boys with more cheerful, happy dispositions
than Don and Bert Gordon possessed, it would be
hard to find anywhere. Don was sixteen years of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
age and his brother one year younger. The former
was a robust, manly youth, who took great delight in
all out-of-doors sports, and who, like many other
healthy youngsters, had some glaring faults that were
the occasion of no little anxiety to his father and
mother. One was his great propensity for mischief.
He was not fond of books or school, but any wild
scheme for &#8220;fun,&#8221; as he called it, particularly if it
involved some risk on the part of those who participated
in it, would enlist his hearty sympathy and cooperation.
This led to the most unpleasant episode
in Don&#8217;s life. He was a student at a certain high
school in a neighboring city, and being thrown into
the company of uneasy spirits like himself, he very
soon so far forgot the solemn promises he had made
his mother before leaving home, that he assisted in
laying plans for mischief which others carried into
execution. After that but little urging was necessary
to induce him to take part in them himself;
and being at last detected in some act that had been
strictly forbidden, he was promptly expelled from
the school.</p>

<p>It was wonderful what a change that made in Don
Gordon. He began to see that his conduct was not
calculated to gain and hold the respect of those whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
respect was worth having, and thus far his resolution
to do better had been firmly adhered to. There is a
turning point in everybody&#8217;s existence&mdash;a time when
a decision made affects one&#8217;s whole after career&mdash;and
who knows but this may have been the critical period
in Don&#8217;s life? It was not the disgrace attending his
expulsion from school that awoke him, for that had
a different effect. It made him spiteful and rebellious.
It was the treatment he received after he reached
home. Fortunately his father and mother were the
kindest parents in the world, and the friendly talk
they had with Don on the evening of the day he
arrived at home, opened the young man&#8217;s eyes; and
every promise he made then had been faithfully kept.
He and his brother were now prosecuting their studies
at home under the direction of a private tutor who
lived in the house with them.</p>

<p>Bert Gordon was not like his brother in anything
except his appearance. His features resembled Don&#8217;s,
but instead of the latter&#8217;s tough, wiry body, he had
a slender little figure that could endure but trifling
exposure and hardship, and a delicate constitution
that had been badly shattered by the plague of that
south-western region&mdash;the fever and ague. He took
but little interest in the violent sports of which his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
brother was so fond; and if he had consulted his own
inclinations, he would any day have chosen an easy-chair
and a good book in preference to a morning&#8217;s
gallop. But the doctor insisted on daily exercise,
and that was one reason why General Gordon had
purchased the &#8220;speckled ponies&#8221; which were so obnoxious
to Godfrey Evans and his son Dan.</p>

<p>The ponies were beauties, and Dan called them
&#8220;circus hosses&#8221; because their color was piebald, like
that of a performing steed he had once seen in a small
show that stopped for a day at Rochdale, as the steamboat-landing
three miles distant was called. Their
long, wavy manes reached to their knees, their tails
swept the ground as they walked, and their favorite
gait was an easy amble which scarcely moved their
riders in the saddles. They were not fiery or swift
enough to suit Don, who always went at a high-pressure
rate, but they suited Bert very well. They
would stand fire like old cavalry horses, and many a
fine bunch of quails and squirrels had their owners
shot from their backs.</p>

<p>As the boys came ambling along, talking and
laughing with each other as though they felt at peace
with themselves and all the world, the inmates of the
cabin turned to look at them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>&#8220;Another dog,&#8221; growled Godfrey, as his eyes
rested on a splendid young pointer that trotted along
behind Don&#8217;s horse. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got a new dog every
day. What it takes to keep them wuthless curs
would make me rich!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are not worthless curs,&#8221; said David, in a
low tone. &#8220;They are fine hunting dogs, and the
general has one that cost him a hundred dollars!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; the Gordons hain&#8217;t got no money, I think I
heared ye say,&#8221; sneered his father. &#8220;How then can
they buy dogs with a hundred dollars, I&#8217;d like to
know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk so loud,&#8221; interrupted David. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t want them to hear you, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t keer who hears me when I say&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then there was a clatter of hoofs in front of
the cabin, which ceased suddenly as the new-comers
drew rein before the open door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is David at&mdash;O, I beg pardon,&#8221; exclaimed a
cheery voice. &#8220;We did not know you were at dinner.
We will wait, as we are in no hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here, and ready to serve you any way I
can,&#8221; said David, rising from the block of wood which
served him for a chair. &#8220;I have finished my dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Don. &#8220;I&#8217;ve brought you a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
dog to break for me. Isn&#8217;t he a beauty? He is a
present from a friend living in Memphis. He is five
months old, and as I found him standing the chickens
in the yard this morning, I think it high time he
was taught something. I&#8217;ll give you what I promised,
and what we gave you for breaking the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Don was speaking, Godfrey, who sat within
reach of his son, turned about on his barrel and slily
pulled David by the sleeve of his coat; but the boy
paid no attention to him&mdash;that is, he did not look at
him. But he did pull his sleeve out of his father&#8217;s
grasp, and move toward the other side of the door
out of reach.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do the best I can with him,&#8221; said David.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that will be as well as anybody can do,&#8221;
returned Don. &#8220;We will leave him in your charge
and I hope the next time I see him, I can take him
to the field for a good day&#8217;s sport. Take the best of
care of him, for he is a valuable animal.&#8221;</p>

<p>David caught the pointer by a collar he wore
around his neck, and led him behind the cabin to a
kennel he had there, while the brothers, after lifting
their hats to Mrs. Evans, turned about and galloped
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a purty son, you are,&#8221; said Godfrey, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
David, having secured the pointer, came back and
seated himself on his block of wood again. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t
yer feel me a pullin&#8217; an&#8217; a haulin&#8217; at yer coat, an&#8217;
tryin&#8217; to tell yer not to promise to break that pup fur
them &#8217;ristocrats?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; answered David.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why didn&#8217;t ye pay some heed to it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I want the ten dollars&mdash;that&#8217;s why.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten dollars!&#8221; repeated Godfrey, opening his
eyes. &#8220;Is that what yer goin&#8217; to get fur it? It&#8217;s
a heap of money fur a boy like you to make so easy,
an&#8217; that&#8217;s just what makes me &#8217;spise them Gordons
so. They&#8217;ve got ten dollars to pay fur breakin&#8217; a
pup that haint wuth his salt, an&#8217; I haint got ten cents
to buy grub with. Just look at this yere!&#8221;</p>

<p>Godfrey went on moving his jack-knife over the
table which was supplied with nothing but corn bread,
fat bacon and buttermilk in the way of eatables and
drinkables.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now aint this a purty mess for a white man an&#8217; a
gentleman to set down to? If I couldn&#8217;t remember
the time when things was different, it wouldn&#8217;t be
nigh so hard; but I can. &#8217;Taint so very long ago
that we had fresh meat, an&#8217; coffee, an&#8217; pies, an&#8217; cakes,
an&#8217; light bread fur grub, an&#8217; I had a pipe of store<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
tobacker to smoke arter eatin&#8217; it; but now&mdash;dog-gone
sich luck!&#8221; cried Godfrey, striking the table
such a blow with his open hand that the dishes jumped
into the air, and the cracked pitcher, which held what
was left of the buttermilk, fell in pieces, allowing its
contents to run out among the plates.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s something else gone up,&#8221; said Godfrey,
his anger appeased for the moment by the sight of
the ruins of the pitcher. &#8220;An&#8217; I haint got no stamps
to buy another. Dave, I don&#8217;t keer if ye be goin&#8217; to
get ten dollars fur it, don&#8217;t ye tech that pinter pup
&#8217;ceptin&#8217; to tote him back where he belongs. Do ye
hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon I do,&#8221; replied David.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, be ye goin&#8217; to mind what I say to ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I aint.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye haint? I say to ye, boy,&#8221; exclaimed Godfrey,
raising his hand over the table again, &#8220;boy, I
say to ye&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, pop, don&#8217;t break no more dishes,&#8221; interrupted
Dan, &#8220;&#8217;kase if ye do, we&#8217;ll have to eat off&#8217;n
bark plates purty soon, an&#8217; drink out&#8217;n gourds. Let
Dave break the pinter pup if he wants to. What
odds does it make to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes a heap of odds, the fust thing ye know,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
replied his father. &#8220;Kase they&#8217;s &#8217;ristocrats, an&#8217;
we&#8217;ve got just as good a right to have ten dollars to
pay somebody fur breakin&#8217; our huntin&#8217; dogs, as they
have. An&#8217; &#8217;sides, don&#8217;t they make things wuss fur
poor folks like us nor they&#8217;d oughter? They do, an&#8217;
this is the way they go about it: Look at them
pack of hound dogs they brought down from Kaintuck
last summer! I don&#8217;t say nothing about the money
they throwed away when they bought &#8217;em, an&#8217; which
was more&#8217;n enough to keep all our jaws a waggin&#8217;
fur one good year, I bet ye, an&#8217; on good grub too,
but I jest axes ye, what&#8217;s them hound dogs fur?
Why just as soon as the leaves begin to fall, them
youngsters will take to the swamps, an&#8217; them hound
dogs will go a tearin&#8217; an&#8217; a yelpin&#8217; through these
woods at sich a rate, that the fust thing we know
the game will all be done drove out of the country,
an&#8217; we can&#8217;t get nu deer nor bar meat fur grub.
That&#8217;s what makes me &#8217;spise them hound dogs so.&#8221;</p>

<p>These remarks of his father&#8217;s recalled to Dan&#8217;s
mind an incident that had happened during the
previous spring. He brightened up suddenly as
if he were thinking of something that afforded
him infinite satisfaction.</p>

<small>GODFREY BUILDS AIR-CASTLES.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;THEM hound dogs needn&#8217;t worry you none,&#8221; said
Dan. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take keer of them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What be ye goin&#8217; to do?&#8221; asked his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to make them two fellers what owns
&#8217;em promise to let my things they finds in the woods
alone, or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Dan glanced hastily at his brother. David
was looking intently at his plate, but the expression
on his face told that he was listening with all his ears.
So Dan did not finish the sentence, but raised his hand
to his face and shut one eye as if he were glancing
along the barrel of a rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; to shoot &#8217;em, be ye?&#8221; exclaimed his father.
&#8220;Wal, say so then, and don&#8217;t be afraid. Nobody
ain&#8217;t agoin&#8217; to harm ye fur it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dan doggedly, seeing that his secret
was out. &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to shoot &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hadn&#8217;t better stay about here after you do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
it,&#8221; said David. &#8220;The general will have the law on
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;ll he find out who done it, I&#8217;d like to
know?&#8221; snapped his brother. &#8220;An&#8217;, &#8217;sides, hain&#8217;t
I got jest as much right to spile his things as his boys
have to spile mine? Didn&#8217;t I meet &#8217;em one day last
spring as they were ridin&#8217; out of the woods on them
circus hosses of their&#8217;n, an&#8217; didn&#8217;t they tell me that
they&#8217;d pulled down more&#8217;n a dozen turkey traps
they&#8217;d found among the hills, kase it was agin the
law, or, if it wasn&#8217;t it had oughter be, to ketch turkeys
at that time of the year? An&#8217; didn&#8217;t I go
straight to the woods when I left them, an&#8217; didn&#8217;t I
find that it was my own traps they had pulled down?
You&#8217;re right I did; an&#8217; I said then that I&#8217;d get even
with &#8217;em some day fur that same piece of work. You
want to keep a close eye on that pinter pup,&#8221; he
added shaking a warning finger at his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you,&#8221; answered David. &#8220;A fellow
who will take revenge on a dumb brute for something
his owner did to him, is mean enough for anything,
and perhaps I had better take good care of myself,
too. If you intend to hurt the dog say so, and I will
take him back where he belongs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, seein&#8217; it&#8217;s you, I wont tech him,&#8221; said Dan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
with more eagerness and haste than the circumstances
seemed to warrant. &#8220;But arter his owner gets him
in his hands, he wants to watch out. Now, pop,&#8221;
added Dan, seeing that his father was about to speak,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you go to raisin&#8217; a row. Let Dave break the
dog, if he wants to. It don&#8217;t cost you nothing.
What did you mean when you said a little while ago
that things is a goin&#8217; to change with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Godfrey&#8217;s face lost its angry scowl and brightened
at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant something that&#8217;ll extonish ye when ye
hear it&mdash;the hul on ye,&#8221; he replied, with a cheerful
wink at his hopeful son, &#8220;an&#8217; it won&#8217;t take me long
to tell it, nuther. You remember that when the war
fust broke out, Gen&#8217;ral Gordon, knowin&#8217; which side
of his bread had the butter onto it, got all his money
changed into gold and silver, and brought it here to
his house an&#8217; hid it, don&#8217;t ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course the family all remembered it. The
incident had offered gossip for the neighborhood for
months after it happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; continued Godfrey, &#8220;when the Yanks
come in here, them gold and silver dollars, an&#8217; all
the watches belongin&#8217; to the family, an&#8217; all the silver
an&#8217; chiny dishes, an&#8217; them gold things Mrs. Gordon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
an&#8217; her gals wore around their wrists, was done took
an&#8217; hid. They was buried in the ground, some in
one place an&#8217; some in another, so&#8217;t the Yanks couldn&#8217;t
find &#8217;em. Mrs. Gordon an&#8217; her gals buried some of
&#8217;em with their own hands, among the flower-beds in
front of the place whar the house then stood, an&#8217; one
of the niggers, ole Jordan&mdash;ye remember him, I
reckon&mdash;done buried the rest. I know, kase Jordan
told me so hisself. Jordan, ye know, was raised by
the gen&#8217;ral&#8217;s father from the time he was a picaninny,
an&#8217; bein&#8217; as honest as a nigger ever gets to be, his
missus she sot a heap of store by him, an&#8217; said thar
wasn&#8217;t no better servant a goin&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, when the gen&#8217;ral&#8217;s wife, she heared that
the Yanks was a comin&#8217; with them gunboats of
their&#8217;n, she sent fur Jordan an&#8217; she says to him:
&#8216;Jordan, you see that thar bar&#8217;l? Thar&#8217;s eighty
thousand dollars in gold an&#8217; silver into it. Now,
Jordan, you take that thar bar&#8217;l, an&#8217; tote it off as
quick as you can, an&#8217; hide it in the ground, an&#8217; remember
an&#8217; don&#8217;t let nobody see ye, an&#8217; don&#8217;t say
nothin&#8217; to nobody, nuther.&#8217; So Jordan he done
tuk the bar&#8217;l an&#8217; rolled it down to the tater
patch, and digged a hole as quick as he could
an&#8217; kivered it up, an&#8217; nobody, not even the missus,
don&#8217;t know whar he put it!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>Here Godfrey paused to take breath, and leaning
his elbows on the table, looked from one to the other
of the little group before him to see what they thought
about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, what of it?&#8221; said Dan, who was the first
to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;What of it?&#8221; repeated his father. &#8220;Thar&#8217;s a
heap of it, the fust thing you know&mdash;a hul bar&#8217;l full;
an&#8217; what&#8217;s to hinder us from gettin&#8217; it fur our own,
I&#8217;d like to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>A gleam of intelligence shot across Dan&#8217;s swarthy
face, and even David and his mother looked up and
began to take some interest in what Godfrey was
saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jordan went off with the Yanks that very night,
an&#8217; he hasn&#8217;t been seed since,&#8221; Godfrey went on.
&#8220;That was ten year ago, come next winter, an&#8217; nobody
don&#8217;t know whar that bar&#8217;l with the eighty
thousand in gold and silver is. I was to hum on a
furlong then, ye know, an&#8217; kept hid in the cane while
the Yanks was here; but I seed Jordan, an&#8217; he told
me that the bar&#8217;l was in the tater patch. I jest happened
to think of it this mornin&#8217; while I was a huntin&#8217;
in the swamp; an&#8217; then I axed myself, wasn&#8217;t I
a dunce to be livin&#8217; in this way, when thar was eighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
thousand dollars to be had fur the diggin&#8217;? An&#8217; I
told myself yes, I was. So I come hum right quick,
an&#8217; I&#8217;m done huntin&#8217; fur a livin&#8217; now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to look fur that barrel, father?&#8221;
asked David.</p>

<p>&#8220;I aint a goin&#8217; to do nothing else. I know right
whar that tater patch was, an&#8217; me an&#8217; Dan&#8217;ll dig it
so full of holes that the folks up to Gordon&#8217;s house
will think an army is goin&#8217; to build a fort thar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what will you do with it if you find it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll I do with it?&#8221; cried Godfrey, rising to
his feet, spreading out his arms and turning slowly
around so that his son could have a good view of him.
&#8220;Can you look at me an&#8217; all of us an&#8217; ax me what
I&#8217;ll do with it? I&#8217;ll keep it fur myself, an&#8217; spend
it like a lord, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you like to have somebody serve you that
way?&#8221; asked David. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be honest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honest!&#8221; Godfrey almost screamed. &#8220;Jest
listen to him, now! That&#8217;s what makes me &#8217;spise
them Gordons so. They can&#8217;t keep their big &#8217;ristocratic
ideas to their selves, but must tell &#8217;em to my
boys, an&#8217; larn one of &#8217;em to say &#8216;father&#8217; an&#8217; &#8216;mother,&#8217;
&#8217;stead of callin&#8217; us &#8216;pop&#8217; an&#8217; &#8216;mam,&#8217; like he had
oughter do. An&#8217; then to talk about my spendin&#8217; my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
time a diggin&#8217; an&#8217; a huntin&#8217; fur that thar bar&#8217;l, an&#8217;
arter findin&#8217; it, to give it up to them as has got
more&#8217;n their share already, an&#8217; here&#8217;s us as poor as
Job&#8217;s turkey! No, sir,&#8221; said Godfrey, emphatically.
&#8220;If I find that thar bar&#8217;l I&#8217;ll keep it, an&#8217; say nothing
to nobody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it belongs to the Gordons,&#8221; said David, not
at all daunted by his father&#8217;s speech, &#8220;and you have
no right to lay a finger on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, you&#8217;ll see if I don&#8217;t lay two whole hands
onto it if I can find it; an&#8217; if I don&#8217;t find it, it won&#8217;t
be kase I don&#8217;t do no diggin&#8217;, I bet ye. Jest think
of it,&#8221; said Godfrey, growing animated over the
prospect of so great and sudden wealth. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
us been a livin&#8217; like the pigs in the gutter all these
years, when we might have been ridin&#8217; our own hosses
an&#8217; growin&#8217; fat off the best kind of grub! Eighty
thousand dollars! Enough to fill a hul bar&#8217;l! Why,
one day, in the good old times, when I was a talkin&#8217;
with the gen&#8217;ral, he says to me: &#8216;Godfrey, how much
is you wuth?&#8217; Wal, I didn&#8217;t know, kase I hadn&#8217;t
never thought of it none; but I told him I had so
many niggers, wuth so much a head; so many cow
brutes; so many hoss an&#8217; mule brutes; so much land;
an&#8217; so many pig brutes runnin&#8217; in the swamp. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
gen&#8217;ral he figures it up, an&#8217; tells me I wus wuth nigh
on to twelve or fifteen thousand dollars, most likely
it was nigher fifteen nor twelve. I tell you I felt
big arter that. I held my head up high, like a steer
in the corn, an&#8217; felt like axin&#8217; every man I met did
he know I wus wuth fifteen thousand dollars, an&#8217; it
all made with these yer two hands, too? But <i>eighty</i>
thousand! Whew! Why didn&#8217;t I think of that bar&#8217;l
long ago? I reckin I&#8217;ll go down to the landin&#8217; an&#8217;
ax Silas Jones will he trust me fur some store tobacker.
I can tell him that I&#8217;ll be able to buy his hul consarn
out next week!&#8221;</p>

<p>As Godfrey said this he arose from his barrel, and,
taking his rifle down from its place over the door,
went out of the cabin followed by Dan, who also carried
a rifle on his shoulder. David and his mother
watched them in silence until they had passed down
the road out of sight, and then turned and looked at
each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it true about the barrel?&#8221; asked the boy at
length.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; was his mother&#8217;s answer,
&#8220;and for the sake of all concerned I hope it is
not. It is true that all the gold and silver, and other
valuables belonging to the Gordon family, were buried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
on the night the levee was cut, and it is equally
true that Jordan buried some of it. He went down
the Pass with the gunboats when they left, and has
never been seen or heard of since. What has become
of him, nobody knows; and whether he went without
telling Mrs. Gordon where he had hidden the valuables,
is a question that no one outside the general&#8217;s
family is able to answer. It may be possible that
he did, for such things have happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When and where?&#8221; asked David.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right here in this neighborhood. After the
war was over, and the soldiers began to return, there
came to this landing a man named Brown, who had
been a sailor on one of the Union gunboats. He did
not look like a person who had more money than he
wanted, but he said he had, and that his object in
coming here was to rent a plantation and go to raising
cotton. As almost everybody was ready to sell
or rent, several plantations were offered him, but the
only one he would look at was Colonel Cisco&#8217;s&mdash;an
old worn-out place that no one else would have as a
gift. The widow&mdash;the colonel was killed in the army,
you know&mdash;was glad to get the hundred dollars Mr.
Brown offered her to bind the bargain, and let him
have the place at once. He said he could do nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
until his partner came from Memphis with the mules,
provisions and other things needed to carry on plantations;
but he took possession of the house, and
lived there two months all by himself. He was never
seen during the daytime. He visited none of the
neighbors, and didn&#8217;t seem to want to have anybody
call on him; but people went all the same, and one
day somebody found out that the flower-beds in the
back yard, on which Mrs. Cisco had spent so much
time, had all been dug up, and that there was a hole
there that one could bury a house in. The man
didn&#8217;t like it at all because it had been found out,
and said he was digging a cellar. It was discovered
afterward, however, that all this work had been done
in the night, and that Mr. Brown never thought of
putting a cellar there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he intend to put there then?&#8221; asked
David, when his mother paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. He hoped to take something out; but
he was taken sick, and that was the end of his scheme.
He had such a hard time getting well, that when he
was able to be about again, he made up his mind
that he had seen enough of the South, and that he
would go home at once and stay there. He wanted
to do something for the people who had been so kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
to him during his sickness, so he took the man who
had done the most for him into his secret, and told
him what had brought him there. In the first place
he had no partner, no money&mdash;only just enough to
pay his railroad and steamboat fare to the place
where he wanted to go&mdash;and no intention of cultivating
the plantation. There was money buried somewhere
near the house&mdash;he wanted it, and this was
the way he found out about it:</p>

<p>&#8220;Attached to the same gunboat to which Mr.
Brown belonged was a negro, who had once been
Colonel Cisco&#8217;s house servant. During the war the
colonel&#8217;s family hid all their valuables in the ground,
just as all our people did who had anything to hide,
and this servant helped them bury money and silver,
to the amount of thirty thousand dollars and over.
After he ran away and got on the gunboat, he told
about it, and boasted that when the war closed he
would soon make a rich man of himself; but he was
taken sick, and this Mr. Brown, who was the doctor&#8217;s
steward, took care of him. Before he died he told
the steward about the buried money, and described
the place where it was hidden so accurately that Mr.
Brown could have found it in the darkest of nights.
That was what made him hire the Cisco plantation.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>&#8220;Well, did he get the money?&#8221; asked David, who
was deeply interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;People think not. If he had found it, he would
not have been likely to say anything about it; and
besides he would have had more than enough
to take him home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t Mrs. Cisco ever say anything about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and laughed at the man for his pains. Her
husband had money once, she said, and buried some
of it a dozen different times; but it was dug up again
as soon as the danger of losing it had passed, and
what they didn&#8217;t use was stolen from them by the
guerillas. She&#8217;s now almost as poor as ourselves,
Mrs. Cisco is. Her house was not burned, and in
that respect only is she better off than we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were rich once, were we not, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we were not rich, but we had enough.
Your father owned a mile square of land that was all
paid for&mdash;he&#8217;s got that yet, but it don&#8217;t seem to do
him any good, for the clearings have all grown up to
briers&mdash;and we had a good house and plenty to eat
and wear. He was a hard-working, saving man then,
and so different from what he is now, that I sometimes
think that somebody else has come to me from the
southern army, and is passing himself off for Godfrey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
We were happy in those days,&#8221; said Mrs. Evans, gazing
earnestly into the little pile of coals on the hearth,
as if the scenes she so well remembered were clearly
pictured there. &#8220;I can remember when our cotton
gin was kept running night and day; and I have
seen eight four-horse teams going up the road toward
the landing loaded with your father&#8217;s cotton. You
can&#8217;t remember anything about it, for you were too
young at the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said David, &#8220;but I can remember when we
lived in that brush shantee that had a fire burning in
front of it night and day; and I can remember of
seeing you cry, and father walking up and down and
swinging his arms as if he were crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was just after we were burned out. You
were four years old then. Until that time we never
thought we should feel much of the war. Although
we were only eight miles from the river, we used to
feel perfectly safe, so far as the Federals were concerned.
We used to see Redburn&#8217;s guerillas about
once a week, but they belonged to our own side, and
at first we did not stand in any fear of them, although
we soon learned to dread them more than we did the
Yankees. We never were afraid that they would
hurt us, but they stole everything they could lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
their hands on, and finally got so bad that General
Imboden sent them word that if they didn&#8217;t do better
he would come in with a regiment and wipe them off
the face of the earth. We never thought that the
Federals would get in here, and you don&#8217;t know how
frightened we were when we found that in a few days
their gunboats would be at our very doors. One day
in February&mdash;that was in &#8217;63&mdash;the Union soldiers
came down from Helena and cut the levee. The
water was high in the river, and it ran down through
the pass and into Diamond lake here, and overflowed
the bottoms until we thought it would drown us all.
Then the gunboats came&mdash;two big iron-clads, a lot
of tin-clads, and six thousand soldiers. They stopped
here long enough to burn every dwelling-house and
cotton-gin in the country for miles around, and then
went on down the pass. Your father was at home
then on a furlough, and I tell you they came pretty
near catching him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How was it?&#8221; asked David, who never grew
weary of listening to the story, although he had heard
it probably a score of times.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>DAN&#8217;S STRATEGY.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;IT happened one day while we were at dinner,&#8221;
replied his mother. &#8220;The Union soldiers had
been at work on the levee for two or three days, and
we were expecting the boats through every hour.
Godfrey kept his saddle on his horse night and day,
and his weapons close at hand, so that he could catch
them up at any moment. While we were eating
dinner on this particular day, your father, who sat
opposite the window, looked up all of a sudden, and
before I could ask him the reason for his pale face,
he was on his feet and out at the door. I looked
through the window, and right here in our lake, and
not fifty yards from the door, was the first gunboat
I had ever seen. The Federals had got through the
levee at last, and one of their boats, being of that
sort which don&#8217;t make any noise when they run, was
right upon us before we knew it. I don&#8217;t know her
name to this day, but she had the figure 9 painted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
on her pilot house, and I could see the cannons
sticking out of the port-holes. On her upper deck
were a lot of cotton bales placed like breastworks,
and behind these cotton bales were fifty or sixty men,
all with muskets in their hands, and watching and
waiting for a chance to shoot at somebody. Well,
they found that chance as soon as your father was
fairly out at the door. Two jumps brought him to
his horse which was hitched in the yard, another put
him in the saddle, and in a minute more he was
running the gauntlet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it strange that he escaped being hit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was providential,&#8221; replied Mrs. Evans. &#8220;I
have heard Godfrey himself say that he could have
shot a squirrel&#8217;s eye out at the distance he was from
the gunboat. They began to shoot at him as soon as
he left the house, and I sat there and looked through
the window and saw them do it. They fired as fast
as they could get a sight at him, and the guns popped
so rapidly that they reminded me of a burning cane-brake.
When they stopped, I managed to get up
and go to the door. There was a big cotton field
where this brier patch is now, and it was half a mile
wide. On the other side of it was a rail fence that
ran between the field and the woods, and there I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Godfrey&#8217;s white horse. I thought at first that
Godfrey wasn&#8217;t with him, but he was. He was
leaning over and throwing the top rails off the fence.
When he had done that, he straightened up, and
seeing me standing in the door, he waived his hat to
let me know that he was safe. Then he jumped his
horse over the fence into the woods, and rode away
out of sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;At that minute you and Daniel began to cry,
and when I turned about to see what the matter was,
I found the road blue with Federals. The boat had
landed in front of the house, and a party was coming
off with an officer. They entered without ceremony,
and asked me who it was that rode off on that white
horse, and if I knew where there were any weapons.
I told them that he was my husband and your father,
and that he had taken all the weapons with him.
They evidently did not believe the last statement, for
they searched every room in the house, and tumbled
things about at a great rate; but they didn&#8217;t break
anything, and all I missed after they were gone was
your father&#8217;s picture which he had just had taken for
me in Rochdale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Having satisfied themselves that there were no
weapons in the house, the sailors went back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
boat, which moved off into the lake, and went down
the Pass toward Coldwater. I was glad when they
were gone, and glad too to be let off so easily, for I
had been told that these gunboat men were awful
fellows; but they never troubled us, although we saw
hundreds of them afterward. It was the soldiers
that did the damage and our experience with them
began the very next day. A transport loaded with
them came into the lake, and the soldiers camped on
our plantation. When they first came, we had cows,
pigs, chickens and milk and butter; but in less than
an hour we had none of these things left, and but
little furniture. They took the rocking-chairs out
to sit in beside their camp-fires, and broke the tables,
washstands and bureaus up into firewood, when there
were plenty of fence-rails to be had for the taking.
Then one of them said there wasn&#8217;t light enough for
them to eat by, but he&#8217;d soon have more, and he did;
for he pulled a straw bed into the middle of one of
the rooms and touched a match to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;How I lived through that night I don&#8217;t know.
When morning came the house was gone and so were
the soldiers; and I was turned out of doors with two
little children to take care of. Your father came
back as soon as the soldiers were all out of sight, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
threw up a little brush shantee, that we lived in, until
some of the neighbors could get together and build
us some better shelter. They put up this cabin for
us, and after we had time to collect the clothing and
furniture the soldiers had left us, we found that we
were not so badly off after all. But the war was
hardly more than half through then, and we had a
good deal to stand before peace was declared. The
guerillas came next, and you see just what they left
us. I thought things would go better with us when
your father came home, but somehow they didn&#8217;t.
Times have been growing harder instead of better.
We&#8217;re getting poorer and poorer every year, and
mercy knows what&#8217;s going to become of us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s one comfort to know that we can&#8217;t be
much worse off than we are now,&#8221; said David. &#8220;It
isn&#8217;t possible. But keep up a good heart, mother.
I&#8217;ve got some news for you, and it&#8217;s better than that
barrel business too, for it&#8217;s honest. I have a chance
to make a hundred and fifty dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Evans opened her eyes and looked at David
without speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fact,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;and Don Gordon is
the one who put me in the way to do it. You know
his father takes lots of papers, and among them is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the <i>Rod and Gun</i>, which tells all about fishing and
hunting. Well, Don was reading this paper the
other day, and he found in it an advertisement asking
for live quail&mdash;fifty dozen of them. He showed it
to me last night, and asked me why couldn&#8217;t I catch
them and send them to the man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who wants them, and what is he going to do
with them after he gets them?&#8221; asked Mrs. Evans.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, somebody up North wants &#8217;em. Don says
they had a hard time up there last winter. The
weather was awful cold, the snow was so deep that
the birds couldn&#8217;t get anything to eat, and the quail
all died. This man belongs to some kind of a club&mdash;a
&#8216;sportsman&#8217;s club,&#8217; I think Don called it&mdash;and he
wants these quail to stock the country again. When
he gets them, he&#8217;s going to turn them loose and let
them go. He offers three dollars and a half a dozen.
Don says it will cost something to send them there,
but that I can make three dollars on every dozen
just as easy as falling off a log. Say, mother, don&#8217;t
say anything to father or Dan about it, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Evans promised that she would not.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; added David, by way of explanation,
&#8220;they always want me to divide when I&#8217;ve got any
money, but they never say a word about sharing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
with me when they have any. Besides, what they
get never does anybody any good, not even themselves;
and, mother, if I get this hundred and fifty,
I want it to do you some good. You need stockings,
and shoes, and a new dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Evans placed her hand tenderly on the boy&#8217;s
head, and told herself that if all her family cared as
much for her comfort as he did, she would fare better.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you can catch so many?&#8221; she
asked. &#8220;Fifty dozen is a large number.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it, but just see what I&#8217;ve done already.
Last winter, when we were so poor that nobody would
trust us for anything to eat, and we couldn&#8217;t raise
money to buy powder and shot to shoot game with,
I kept the family in food, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Evans remembered it perfectly, and knew
that providing the family with something to eat was
not all this fifteen year old boy had done during that
hard winter. By the aid of his traps he had kept his
mother comfortably clothed, and it was seldom indeed
that he could not produce a dollar for the purchase
of such luxuries as tea and coffee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued David, &#8220;one trap did it all.
It caught just as many quail as we could eat and sell.
One day I took twenty-seven out of it. This winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
I shall set a dozen traps, and suppose I catch five a
day in each one of them! If I do, it will take me
just ten days to fill the order.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But wouldn&#8217;t it first be a good plan to write to
this man and make a bargain with him? Suppose
somebody traps and sends him the fifty dozen before
you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, that&#8217;s all provided for. Don said he would
write to the man last night, and I shall not begin
until I hear from him. One hundred and fifty dollars
for the quail, and ten dollars for breaking the pointer.
One hundred and sixty dollars in all. That will help
us through the winter, and if father and Dan would
only do something to bring in as much more, we&#8217;d
get along well enough. But I must be off to the
fields now, mother. I&#8217;ll have a quail for your supper,
sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>As David said this he took a rusty, single barrel
shot gun down from some hooks over the door, threw
a miserable apology for a game bag over his shoulder,
kissed his mother and went out of the cabin. He
unfastened the pointer, and with the animal trotting
contentedly at his heels, made his way through the
brier-patch toward the nearest open field.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing I didn&#8217;t tell mother,&#8221; thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
David, &#8220;and that is, I can get ten dollars just as
soon as I have a mind to ask for it. It will take
perhaps two months to break this dog so that he will
work even passably well in the field; but I needn&#8217;t
wait that long for the money, because Don told me
I could have it whenever I wanted it. You see he
isn&#8217;t afraid to trust me. If it wasn&#8217;t for the looks
of the thing I&#8217;d ask him for it this very afternoon.
But I&#8217;ll wait a day or two, and then won&#8217;t I astonish
mother with the bundle of things I&#8217;ll bring her from
the store? Dan and father shan&#8217;t see a cent of it,
and neither will I spend any of it on myself. Mother
needs it more than anybody else, and she shall have
it all. Hallo!&#8221; exclaimed David, as the little piping
note of warning the quail utters when suddenly disturbed,
fell on his ear. &#8220;Come here, pup&mdash;I declare,
I forgot to ask your master what your name is&mdash;come
here, and let&#8217;s see how much or how little you
know!&#8221;</p>

<p>David was standing close beside a fence which
ran between the brier-patch and a stubble-field. He
looked over into the field when he heard the notes
of warning, and saw a flock of quails running through
the stubble, and directing their course toward a
little thicket of bushes that grew on the banks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
a bayou near by. Had Dan Evans been there with
that shot gun in his hands, he would have blazed
away at once, and could hardly have failed to kill
or wound three or four of the flock, so closely were
they huddled together. That was the kind of a
hunter Dan was; but David, having learned what
he knew of bird shooting from Don Gordon, who
was a thoroughbred young sportsman, would have
allowed the game to go off scot free before he would
have made a &#8220;pot shot&#8221; at them. Shooting on the
wing requires skill on the part of the hunter, and
gives the game the best chance for its life; and this
was the method David always adopted. He lifted
the pup over the fence, got over himself, and with a
waive of his hand and a &#8220;Hie on, old boy!&#8221; walked
toward the spot where the flock had last been seen.</p>

<p>The dog seemed to understand him perfectly, and
was off like a shot. Of course he would not quarter
the ground in obedience to a motion of the boy&#8217;s
hand&mdash;he had not learned that yet&mdash;but he searched
the stubble thoroughly, and when he struck the trail
of the running flock, he began to follow it up like an
old dog. Suddenly he stopped and stood as motionless
as if he had been turned into stone. He was
pointing a quail hidden in the stubble almost under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
his nose. David walked up, flushed the bird, and
when it was in the air stopped it as neatly with his
old rusty gun as any champion shot could have done
it. Then the training of the dog began. He did
not drop to shot nor did he come to heel when ordered
to do so; and these things, together with many others,
must be taught him before he could be called an
educated bird dog. With perfect confidence in
David&#8217;s ability to break him to his owner&#8217;s entire
satisfaction, we will leave him to the enjoyment of
his afternoon&#8217;s sport, and go back to Godfrey and
Dan, whom we left walking down the road toward the
steamboat landing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Dan,&#8221; exclaimed Godfrey, as soon as they
were out of hearing of David and his mother, &#8220;ye
wouldn&#8217;t mind goin&#8217; over to the gen&#8217;ral&#8217;s an&#8217; axin&#8217;
some of his niggers fur the loan of a shovel fur a few
days, would ye? We hain&#8217;t got nothin&#8217; to dig up
that thar bar&#8217;l with. Ye needn&#8217;t mind tellin&#8217; what
we want it fur, ye know. If anybody axes ye, ye
might say yer mother&#8217;s poorly from the fever&#8217;n ager,
an&#8217; ye want to dig up some yarbs to make her some
tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Dan. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I had a dollar,&#8221; continued his father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
&#8220;Thar&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be a shootin&#8217; match fur beef down
to the landin&#8217; this arternoon, an&#8217; if I could go in, I&#8217;d
be a&#8217;most sartin to win one of the hind-quarters.
Thar hain&#8217;t many can beat me shootin&#8217;, thar hain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon mebbe I mought find a dollar fur ye,
if ye&#8217;ll promise honor bright to pay it back to me,&#8221;
said Dan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll find a dollar fur me?&#8221; exclaimed his father,
opening his eyes in amazement. &#8220;Whar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, now, it don&#8217;t make no odds to ye whar I
git it, so long as I git it, does it?&#8221; asked Dan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nary time,&#8221; replied his father, suddenly stopping
in the road and extending his hand to his son.
&#8220;Ye allers was a good boy, Dannie, an&#8217; fur downright
&#8217;cuteness an&#8217; smartness I&#8217;ll match ye agin them
book-larnt fellers up to the gen&#8217;ral&#8217;s any time. In
course it don&#8217;t make no sort of odds to me whar ye
git the dollar, nor how ye git it nuther, so long as
ye do git it. Ye ain&#8217;t a foolin&#8217; me now?&#8221; added Godfrey,
looking suspiciously at his son. It was not
often that Dan had any money of his own, and his
offer to lend so large an amount as a dollar, astonished
and perplexed his father, who found it hard
work to persuade himself that his ears had not deceived
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>&#8220;No, I hain&#8217;t a foolin&#8217; ye,&#8221; returned Dan. &#8220;Ye
go on down to the landin&#8217; now, an&#8217; when I come thar
I&#8217;ll have the dollar in my pocket, an&#8217; the shovel hid
away somewhar so&#8217;t I can easy find it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer a good boy, Dannie, an&#8217; I&#8217;m monstrous proud
of yer,&#8221; said Godfrey, once more giving his son&#8217;s
hand a hearty gripe and shake. &#8220;An&#8217;, Dannie, if
the time ever comes when&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Godfrey suddenly paused, while an expression of
great astonishment and even of pain settled on his
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; said he, in a tone of voice very unlike
that he had just used in addressing his son, &#8220;ye
hain&#8217;t been an&#8217; found that bar&#8217;l with the eighty
thousand in it, has yer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I hain&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Dan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kase if ye have, and ye don&#8217;t go havers with
yer poor ole pop, what&#8217;s fit the Yanks an&#8217; worked so
hard to support ye like a gentleman&#8217;s son had oughter
be supported, ye&#8217;ll be the meanest boy that ever was
wrapped up in ragged clothes, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll take the cowhide
to ye, big as ye be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, ye needn&#8217;t go to ravin&#8217; that thar way,
kase I hain&#8217;t found the bar&#8217;l,&#8221; said Dan; &#8220;if I had,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
I should have brung it to ye the fust thing. I didn&#8217;t
know it was thar till ye told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am powerful glad to hear it, Dannie,&#8221; said
Godfrey, greatly relieved; &#8220;ye&#8217;d oughter brung it
to me if ye&#8217;d found it, kase I&#8217;m yer pop. I&#8217;m the
oldest an&#8217; know what&#8217;s best fur us all, an&#8217; it&#8217;s the
properest thing that I should have the dealin&#8217; out
of the money when we gets it. But ye&#8217;ll find I
won&#8217;t be no ways stingy. I&#8217;ll dress ye up like a
gentleman, an&#8217; ye shall have a circus hoss too, if ye
want one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, pop, don&#8217;t forget that, will yer?&#8221; said
Dan, a broad grin overspreading his face, when he
thought how delighted he should feel if he could only
ride about the country as neatly dressed and as well
mounted as Don and Bert Gordon, whom he greatly
envied. &#8220;An&#8217; I wants one of them guns what
breaks in two in the middle, an&#8217; you shove the powder
an&#8217; shot in behind, &#8217;stead of drivin&#8217; them down
with a ramrod. An&#8217; I want one of them fishpoles
that a feller can take all to pieces an&#8217; carry under
his arm, an&#8217; sum of them shiny boots that ye can
allers see yer face in no matter whether ye black &#8217;em
or not&mdash;sich as Don wears on Sundays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye shall have &#8217;em all, my son,&#8221; said Godfrey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
encouragingly, &#8220;an&#8217; as many more things us ye
want. Now here we are at the gen&#8217;ral&#8217;s lane. I&#8217;ll
go on, an&#8217; when I see ye agin I shall look fur that
dollar sartin. I&#8217;ll be an awful tuk back, deceived
an&#8217; upsot man if I don&#8217;t have a hand in that shootin&#8217;
match,&#8221; added Godfrey, hoping by the use of adjectives
to convey to Dan&#8217;s mind some idea of the intense
and bitter disappointment he should feel if the
expected dollar was not forthcoming.</p>

<p>Dan repeated the promise which he had made so
often that he was tired of it, and the two separated,
Godfrey keeping on towards the landing, while Dan
turned up the lane that led toward General Gordon&#8217;s
house. The boy made his way at once to the barn,
and there found a negro hostler, who, after listening
to his request, brought out a shovel, which he handed
to Dan with many injunctions to be careful of it,
and to return it the minute he was done using it.
Dan readily promised, and, wondering what the
hostler would think if he knew that the implement
was to be used to unearth some of the general&#8217;s buried
wealth, leaned the shovel up in one corner
where he could find it again when he wanted it.
Then placing his rifle beside it, he bent his steps
toward the house, and passing around one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
wings, in which he knew the boys&#8217; room was located,
discovered Bert Gordon sitting by an open window
reading a book.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Dan,&#8221; said the latter, &#8220;are you looking
for any one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I come over to see Mr. Don,&#8221; said Dan, touching
his hat respectfully and being very careful to put
in the mister. Dan was always very polite when he
had an object in view.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone off somewhere&mdash;down to the landing,
I think,&#8221; said Bert; &#8220;can I do anything for
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon,&#8221; replied Dan, &#8220;Mr. Bert, if ye please,
sar, Dave axed me would I come up here an&#8217; ax
Mr. Don would he give him five of the ten dollars
he promised him fur breakin&#8217; that pinter pup, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um!&#8221; said Bert, somewhat surprised at the
request. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t David come himself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, ye see, he hated fur to pester ye. Kase
you&#8217;ns has allers been so good to us, an&#8217; we&#8217;re so
dog-gone poor that we hain&#8217;t got no money to buy
a new dress fur mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Bert, throwing down his book and
jumping to his feet. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t so much money of
my own, but perhaps I can borrow it of mother.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>He disappeared as he ceased speaking, while Dan
stood chuckling over his good fortune, and hardly
able to restrain himself, so delighted was he at the
success of his stratagem.</p>

<p>&#8220;In course he&#8217;ll get it of his mother,&#8221; said Dan,
&#8220;he&#8217;d get her head if he axed fur it. Didn&#8217;t I tell
the ole man that I&#8217;d give him that dollar? I reckon
we can both go to that shootin&#8217; match now. Sarvent,
Mr. Bert; much obliged to ye, sar,&#8221; he added aloud,
as the boy came down the steps at that moment and
handed him a crisp, new five-dollar bill; &#8220;if we an&#8217;
Dave can ever do ye a good turn, I hope ye&#8217;ll call
on us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bert said he would, and went back to his chair
and his book, while Dan retraced his steps to the
stable, picked up the shovel and his rifle, and went
out into the lane. The shovel he hid in a fence corner,
taking care to mark the spot so that he could
find it again in the dark, if necessity should require
it, and then shouldered his rifle and turned toward
the landing. The money he carried in his hand, and
feasted his eyes on it as he walked along. He could
not admire it enough. He had owned but few bills
so large as this in his lifetime, and he thought them
the most beautiful things he had ever seen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>&#8220;I must make it go as fur as I can,&#8221; said he, to
himself, &#8220;an&#8217; I must have the other one, too. How
am I goin&#8217; to get it, I wonder? Mother can&#8217;t want
another new dress right away, in course not; but
she can be tuk awful sick with the ager, an&#8217; want
some money to buy some store tea, an&#8217; we hain&#8217;t got
none to give her. Won&#8217;t Dave jaw though when he
finds it out? Who keers! He spends every cent he
gits fur mother, an&#8217; I reckon me an&#8217; pop has a right
to some of it. Pop&#8217;ll be awful oneasy to find out
whar I got it, but if I tell him he&#8217;ll go back an&#8217; get
the other hisself; so I won&#8217;t tell him. I must get
it broke too at the store afore I see him; kase if he
knows I&#8217;ve got so much, mebbe he&#8217;ll want it all.
&#8217;Tain&#8217;t best to trust pop too fur.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps the reader will now see why Dan was so
anxious that his father should not prevent David
from promising to break Don Gordon&#8217;s pointer. He
wanted those ten dollars very badly, had made up
his mind to have them; and now that he had half
the amount in his pocket, he was supremely happy.
He had robbed his brother, and abused Bert&#8217;s confidence,
but those were matters that did not trouble
him in the least. He had the money, and that was
all he cared for.</p>

<small>THE SHOOTING MATCH.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE steamboat landing toward which Godfrey
Evans bent his way, was looked upon as a very
important place by the settlers in that part of the
state. The little collection of houses that had sprung
up there contained a post-office, a few dwellings, and
the only grocery and drug store to be found within
a circle of twenty miles. The mail was brought there
twice each week by a mounted carrier, who made
regular trips between the landing and the county
seat, which lay fifteen miles from the river. No particular
packet stopped there, but there was considerable
business done by the neighboring planters with
the city of Memphis, in the way of plantation supplies
and farming implements, and some steamboat called
at the landing every week. Its arrival was regarded
as an event of great consequence. Whenever five
long whistles announced that a steamer was approaching,
all the negroes and unemployed whites within
hearing of the sound would hasten to the landing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
see her come in, and watch the unloading of the cargo
she brought. The sight was not a new or novel
one to them, but the life they led there was so
monotonous that any event, however trivial, that
furnished them fresh topics for an hour&#8217;s conversation,
was gladly welcomed. Godfrey Evans never missed
a boat rain or shine. He was there nearly every day,
and if he chanced to be absent some of the hangers-on
always noticed it, and wondered what could be
the matter.</p>

<p>Toward the landing Godfrey hastened after parting
from his son, and entering the street which ran from
the river back into the country, found himself in front
of the grocery, and in the midst of a group of men
who were congregated there. They all carried rifles
in their hands, and the sharp, whip-like reports which
now and then came from a little grove situated a few
rods up the river bank, told that the shooting match
was in progress.</p>

<p>Godfrey entered the store and drawing up before
the counter, rapped on it with his knuckles to attract
the attention of the proprietor, who was busy in the
little room that opened off the rear. The rap quickly
brought him out, but when he saw who his customer
was, he stopped and asked:&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Godfrey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take a plug of that amazin&#8217; fine ole Virginy
of your&#8217;n, if ye please, sir,&#8221; said Godfrey, leaning his
rifle against the counter and thrusting his hand into
his pocket.</p>

<p>The grocery keeper whistled softly to himself, but
made no move to produce the required article. He
wanted first to see what would be the result of his
customer&#8217;s investigations. Godfrey continued to
search his pockets&mdash;every one of them had a hole in
it that he could have run his hand through&mdash;and his
movements grew quicker, as his impatience to find
something in them increased, and then slower, as the
fact appeared to dawn upon him that there was
nothing there.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to pull out anything, Godfrey,&#8221;
said the merchant.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s a fact, I don&#8217;t seem to,&#8221; replied the customer.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve left my pocket-book to hum, arter all.
Say, Silas,&#8221; he added, sinking his voice almost to a
whisper, and glancing hastily toward the crowd of
men at the door, &#8220;ye wouldn&#8217;t mind trustin&#8217; me till
next week, I reckon, would ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I would,&#8221; was the blunt reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only till next week, I say,&#8221; repeated Godfrey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have more money then nor a mule can haul
away, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll pay ye every red cent I owe ye!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, <i>then</i> I&#8217;ll sell you everything you want,&#8221;
said the merchant.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; won&#8217;t ye let me have nothin&#8217; now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t. And, Godfrey, you&#8217;d be better off
if you would save your half dollars and buy yourself
a pair of shoes. It will not be long, now, before the
cold winter rains will set in, and there&#8217;ll be frost and
snow&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; interrupted Godfrey. &#8220;But I can kill
a heap of deer atween this time and that, an&#8217; deer
meat is goin&#8217; to be wuth something han&#8217;some this
year, kase game is so skase. Come on now,
Silas!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Silas went off to the other side of the store to
attend to the wants of another customer, and Godfrey,
finding that no further notice was taken of his
presence, picked up his rifle, went out of the door,
and turned his face up the road again in the direction
from which Dan was expected to appear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never do no more tradin&#8217; with Silas,&#8221; said
Godfrey to himself. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send to Memphis fur my
things, the way the rest of the gentlemen do; an&#8217; I
shall be as fine a gentleman as the best of &#8217;em when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
I find that bar&#8217;l, won&#8217;t I? Halloa, Dannie! whar&#8217;s
that dollar? I reckon ye&#8217;ve got it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan was coming along the road with his head down,
and his eyes fastened on the five-dollar bill, which
he still held in his hand. Had his father remained
silent, he could have walked up close to him before
Dan would have known that there was any one near,
so fully was his attention taken up with the greenback.
Surprised and startled by the abrupt address, he
hastily crumpled up the money and thrust it into his
pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that yer shovin&#8217; out of sight so quick
thar?&#8221; demanded Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haint a shovin&#8217; nothin&#8217; out of sight,&#8221; answered
Dan. &#8220;Can&#8217;t a feller put his gold toothpick into his
pocket if he wants to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whar&#8217;s the dollar?&#8221; inquired his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hain&#8217;t got to the landin&#8217; yet, have I?&#8221; asked
Dan, in reply. &#8220;I told ye that when I got to the
<i>landin&#8217;</i> I&#8217;d have it fur ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>His father looked at him suspiciously. &#8220;Whar
are ye goin&#8217; to git it down here, an&#8217; who&#8217;s goin&#8217; to
give it to ye?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t ye tell me that it don&#8217;t make no sort of
odds to ye whar I git it, or who gives it to me, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
long as I git it?&#8221; demanded Dan, impatiently.
&#8220;Now, ye go down to the grove an&#8217; stay thar, an&#8217;
when I come to ye, I&#8217;ll give ye the dollar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Godfrey was satisfied with this assurance&mdash;at least
he appeared to be. He walked along with Dan until
they came to the turn in the road, and then he went
toward the grove where the shooting was going on,
while Dan turned toward the post-office. The latter
watched his father until he saw him join one of the
little groups of men who were congregated under
the trees, and then faced about and entered the
store.</p>

<p>There were several customers in there, and Dan
was obliged to await his turn. It came at last, and
then he handed out his five-dollar bill, with the request
that it might be changed into notes of smaller
denomination. The grocer rapidly complied, and as
Dan gathered up his money and turned to go out, he
was astonished to find his father standing at his elbow.
Being barefooted, Godfrey had entered the store and
placed himself close by his son&#8217;s side without being
observed. His face wore a look of amazement that
was curious to behold. He did not know how much
money Dan had in his possession, but he judged by
the size of the roll he held in his hands, that it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
be a large amount. He marvelled greatly as he followed
the boy out of the store.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s yer dollar, pop,&#8221; said Dan, who, finding
that his secret was discovered, thought it best to put
a bold face on the matter. &#8220;I told ye I&#8217;d be sartin
to get it fur ye. Ye mustn&#8217;t forget to pay it back,
or to get me them nice things ye promised when we
find that bar&#8217;l.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Godfrey, smiling joyously as
he felt the bill between his fingers. &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to
be a good pop to ye, Dannie, an&#8217; now I&#8217;ll tell ye what
I&#8217;ve been a thinkin&#8217; of doin&#8217; fur ye: yer gettin&#8217; to
be an amazin&#8217; fine, strappin&#8217; big boy, Dannie. Yer
a&#8217;most as high up in the world as yer pop, an&#8217; purty
soon ye&#8217;ll be gettin&#8217; to be a young man. Then ye&#8217;ll
want store clothes an&#8217; all sorts of nice things, and
mebbe me an&#8217; yer poor ole mam&#8217;ll lose yer, kase
ye&#8217;ll be lookin&#8217; around fur a wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan grinned and thought of the little tow-headed
girl he had so often been on the point of seeing safe
home from church. The reason he didn&#8217;t do it was
because when the critical time came, he could never
muster up courage enough to speak to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ye will,&#8221; continued his father; &#8220;an&#8217; then
ye&#8217;ll find that thar hain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; in the world that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
takes with the gals, an&#8217; the men folks too, like good
clothes an&#8217; shiny boots an&#8217; hats. But it takes money
to get them things. Now, I hain&#8217;t a goin&#8217; to be the
mean ole hulks to ye that my pop was to me. He
left me with empty hands, to make a livin&#8217; as best I
could, but I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to be a good pop to ye, an&#8217; give
ye a fine start. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to give ye half that bar&#8217;l
when I find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much&#8217;ll that be?&#8221; asked Dan.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, it&#8217;ll be a heap, I tell yer,&#8221; replied Godfrey,
growing animated and hoping thus to work upon
Dan&#8217;s feelings sufficiently to accomplish the object
he had in view; &#8220;as much as&mdash;as&mdash;twenty thousand
anyhow, an&#8217; mebbe sixty,&#8221; added Godfrey, who was
not very quick at figures. &#8220;An&#8217; then, Dannie, if
yer a monstrous good boy, an&#8217; allers do jest as I tell
ye, mebbe I&#8217;ll buy out Gen&#8217;ral Gordon an&#8217; give ye
his place. Then ye can have circus hosses, as many
as ye want, an&#8217; some of them amazin&#8217; fine guns what
break in two in the middle, an&#8217; a sail-boat on the
lake, an&#8217; all the other nice things sich as Bert and
Don has got.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan grinned again and fairly trembled with excitement.
The prospect of owning all these aids to
happiness was enough to excite anybody.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>&#8220;Now, Dannie, I won&#8217;t forget all this if ye will
promise to be a good boy an&#8217; do jest what I tell yer,&#8221;
said his father. &#8220;Will ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, pop,&#8221; replied the boy, shaking hands with
his sire, to show that he was in earnest. &#8220;Ye jest
see if I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m powerful glad to hear ye say so, Dannie,&#8221;
continued Godfrey; and now he came to the point
at which he had all the while been aiming, but he
broached it with no little hesitation, and anxiety as
to the result.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Dannie,&#8221; said he, &#8220;don&#8217;t ye think that
to pay me fur all these things I&#8217;m a goin&#8217; to do fur
ye, that ye&#8217;d oughter give me the rest of the money
ye&#8217;ve got in yer pocket?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Dan, promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What fur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kase I want it myself. I&#8217;m agoin&#8217; into the
shootin&#8217; match too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; shoot agin yer poor old pop, what&#8217;s fit the
Yanks, an&#8217; worked so hard fur ye? Dan, I&#8217;m extonished
at yer! Now, Dannie, I wouldn&#8217;t go in, if
I was ye, kase ye can&#8217;t win nothin&#8217;, an&#8217; &#8217;sides ye
want to save yer money, don&#8217;t ye? That&#8217;s the way
to get rich, Dannie. Let yer pop do the shootin&#8217;,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
an&#8217; we&#8217;ll have a quarter of beef to carry home to-night,
I warrant ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Dan would make no promises, and neither
could his father&#8217;s most earnest entreaties induce him
to surrender even the smallest portion of the money
he had in his pocket. What he had in his possession
he was sure of&mdash;the barrel, with its eighty thousand
dollars, he was not sure of; and believing that a
single bird in the hand was worth a whole flock in
the woods, he declared it to be his unalterable determination
to hold fast to every cent he had. Godfrey
was highly exasperated, but he took good care not to
show it. Their near approach to the grove and to
the men assembled there, obliged him to cease his
entreaties, and with the mental resolve that Dan
should be made to repent his refusal, Godfrey went
to hunt up the man who had charge of the shooting.
To his great delight he learned that there were so
many contestants that the entrance fee was only
seventy-five cents. This left him a quarter of a dollar
to spend, and he made all haste to do it. Forgetting
the resolution he had formed a short time
before, to spend no more money with Silas Jones, he
hurried off to the store, and returned with a plug of
the tobacco for which the merchant had refused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
credit him. When he came back, he saw Dan
stretched out on the ground behind a small log squinting
along the barrel of his rifle, which was pointed
at a piece of white paper fastened to a board, and
placed against a tree a few yards away.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ongrateful scamp!&#8221; said his father, to himself.
&#8220;He&#8217;s gone an&#8217; spent six bits to go into the
shootin&#8217; match arter all. He ain&#8217;t fit to have money,
he throws it about so scandalous. I&#8217;ll take keer
that he don&#8217;t throw away no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the benefit of our city readers, who may like
to know something of the sports and pastimes of those
whose means of recreation are not so abundant as
their own, we will tell how a shooting match is conducted
in the South and West. In the first place,
we are glad to say that it is very different from turkey
shooting as carried on in the Northern States. In
the latter there is no sport whatever. The luckless
turkey is tied to a stump, so that it has no chance
for life, and the marksmen station themselves at distances
varying from one to two hundred and fifty
yards, and shoot at it, until some one kills or wounds
it. It is a cruel practice, and no boy or man either
who has the least spark of humanity or love of fair
play in him, will engage in it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p064.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Shooting-Match.</span></p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>In the shooting matches of which we speak, the contestants
do not shoot at the game, but at a mark.
Each one provides himself with a piece of board,
which is held over a fire until one side of it is
thoroughly blackened. Upon this blackened surface
a cross, like the sign +, is made with the point of
a knife. The place where these two lines intersect
is called the centre; and as it is no larger than the
point of a pin, you can easily imagine how much
skill is required to make a &#8220;dead-centre&#8221; shot. On
this centre, to show where it is, is placed a piece of
white paper&mdash;it may be half an inch or three or six
inches square, as the shooter prefers&mdash;which is held
in its place by a tack or wooden pin. The contestants
then station themselves forty or sixty yards
away, according as they want to shoot off-hand or
with a rest, and the sport begins. The one who
makes the best shot takes the first choice of the prizes,
whatever they may be; the one who makes the
second best, takes the second choice; and so on until
all the prizes are gone.</p>

<p>These prizes may be turkeys, chickens or pigs;
but beef is shot for more than anything else. Whatever
the article is, it is furnished by some one of the
contestants who sets a price upon it, and collects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
each one who participates in the shooting an equal part
of the amount. Thus, if a beef worth twenty dollars
is shot for and there are twenty contestants, each one
pays the owner a dollar. In this case there are six
prizes&mdash;the two hind-quarters, the two fore-quarters,
the hide and tallow, and the lead that is shot into
the tree against which the boards are placed. The
last prize is of no small value sometimes, especially
to men who live four or five miles from a store. If
there are twenty contestants and each one shoots a
dozen times, the chunk of lead which will be cut out
of the tree by the one who wins it, will furnish bullets
enough to last him a year. As soon as the
shooting is over the beef is killed, and each one
takes whatever he may have been skilful enough
to win.</p>

<p>This was the kind of a match that Dan and his
father attended; and the result of it was not a little
surprising to the latter. If it had not been for Dan&#8217;s
good shooting, the two would have been obliged to
return home empty-handed. Godfrey&#8217;s great skill
with the rifle, of which he so often boasted, was not
made apparent on this particular day. He got nothing,
but Dan won a prize. He made four centres,
but three of them had to be placed against the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
number of centres made by other marksmen. When
that had been done the boy had still one centre left,
and that entitled him to the first choice. Dan was
highly elated, and his father was correspondingly
enraged.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ungrateful rascal,&#8221; said Godfrey to himself,
&#8220;to come here an&#8217; shoot agin&#8217; his poor ole pop what&#8217;s
done so much fur him, an&#8217; make me take a back seat!
I eddicated that boy myself. I larnt him how to
handle a rifle, and now I wish I hadn&#8217;t done it, kase
this is the kind of pay I get fur it. I&#8217;ll take mighty
good keer that he don&#8217;t get no more seventy-five cents
to spend at shootin&#8217; matches. It beats all natur&#8217;
whar he got that wad of money, an&#8217; if I had another
dollar I&#8217;d give it to know!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Godfrey said nothing. He knew that if he
spoke as he felt, it would put Dan on his guard, and
that might lead to the derangement of certain plans
he had formed. So he laughed at the witty things
that were said to him about being beaten by his own
son, and when some one complimented Dan on the
skill he had exhibited, his father said it might have
been expected, for the boy was simply a chip of the
old block.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m monstrous proud of ye, Dannie,&#8221; said Godfrey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
as the two wended their way toward home after
the shooting was over; &#8220;monstrous proud. It done
me good to see them ole fellers look wild when ye
made them centres so handy, one arter t&#8217;other.
I&#8217;m a trifle sorry that ye spent yer money so scandalous
foolish, but it can&#8217;t be helped now. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t
the way to get rich, Dannie, that ar way aint, an&#8217; I
hope ye won&#8217;t do it no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the way Godfrey talked; but had he
acted out his feelings, he would have fallen upon
Dan with the cowhide the moment they reached the
cabin.</p>

<p>The three miles that lay between the landing and
the Evans plantation being accomplished, Godfrey,
with the air of a man who had done a day&#8217;s work
with which he was perfectly satisfied, seated himself
on a bench beside the door, preparatory to indulging
in a pipeful of the store tobacco which had come into
his possession so unexpectedly; while Dan proceeded
to the corn-crib behind the house, and harnessed an
old and very infirm mule to a rickety wagon, intending
to return to the landing and bring home the quarter
of beef that had fallen to his lot. He went about
his task in that peculiar and indescribable way a boy
has of doing things when he has something in view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
besides the work in hand. His movements were
stealthy, and he cast frequent and furtive glances
around him, as if he were afraid of being caught in
some act that would bring him certain and speedy
punishment.</p>

<p>Once or twice he moved quickly to the cabin
and looked around the corner, to make sure that
his father was still seated where he had left him.
He always found him there. He never seemed to
have changed his position. He sat with his legs
stretched out before him, his hands thrust deep into
his pockets, his head bowed, his eyes closed and his
beloved pipe tightly clenched between his teeth.
He was asleep; and Dan, having made sure of this,
quickly returned to the corn-crib and halted under a
shed which was built on one side of it. This shed
was used to shelter the wagon, the few farming implements
Godfrey possessed, and also the harness,
which, when not in use, was kept hung up on a
wooden pin driven into one of the logs of which the
corn-crib was built. Dan came to a stop under this
pin, and after looking all around again to make sure
that there was no one watching him, he seized it
with both hands, and after working it backward and
forward a few times, finally pulled it out.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>Looking into the hole, as if to satisfy himself that
something he had previously placed there was safe,
Dan drew a roll of bills out of his pocket, and, after
running his eye over them to make sure that they
were all there, thrust them into the hole, and with
one quick blow with his hand drove the pin back to
its place. This done, he jumped into the wagon,
picked up the knotted lines, and as he drove around
the corner of the cabin, took care to notice his father&#8217;s
position. Godfrey was still asleep&mdash;there could be
no doubt about that. His pipe was twisted about in
his mouth, until the bowl pointed downward, his head
was thrown over on one side, and as Dan looked at
him, he told himself that he was disposed of for two
long hours, at least. Yet so suspicious was he, that
he did not neglect to turn and look at him every
now and then as long as he remained in sight of the
cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s thar yet, an&#8217; I reckon I&#8217;ve fixed things all
right,&#8221; thought Dan, with a chuckle denoting intense
satisfaction. &#8220;He&#8217;s been kinder snoopin&#8217; around
ever since he found out I had that money, an&#8217; I was
afeared that mebbe he&#8217;d smell out somethin&#8217;. He
thinks I don&#8217;t know it, but I&#8217;ve seed him more&#8217;n
once sarchin&#8217; my pockets arter I went to bed, an&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
he thought I was asleep. He was a lookin&#8217; fur gun
caps, an&#8217; things he couldn&#8217;t buy hisself. I reckon
he hain&#8217;t made much outen me since I found that
hidin&#8217; place fur my money an&#8217; sich plunder. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t
safe to trust pop no further nor a feller can see
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>With these sage reflections, Dan drove on toward
the landing.</p>

<small>GODFREY FINDS SOMETHING.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Dan drove around the corner of the
cabin, the slumbering Godfrey, without changing
his position, opened one of his eyes, but quickly
closed it again as Dan turned about in his wagon to
look at him. Presently he opened it again, and
kept it open until Dan once more turned to look at
him; and the farther the wagon left the house behind,
the oftener the eye was opened, and the longer it remained
open. When the wagon and its driver had
disappeared around a bend in the road, Godfrey
opened both eyes, straightened up, stretching his arms
and yawning as if he had just awakened out of a
sound sleep, turned his pipe about in his mouth, and
with an expression of great satisfaction on his face,
arose and went around the corner of the house toward
the corn-crib. He walked straight to the shed that
stood beside it, and placing his hand on the same pin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
that Dan had removed but a few minutes before,
pulled it out and looked into the opening.</p>

<p>He was surprised at the size of it. By the aid of
a gouge, or some other sharp instrument, the inside
of the hole had been cut away until a cavity had been
formed that would hold a quart or more; and in this
were two or three small packages, done up in brown
paper. Godfrey opened his knife and poked them
out one by one. The first contained the greenbacks
of which he was in search. He counted them over
carefully, and was greatly disappointed and surprised
to find that the whole amount was only three dollars
and twenty-five cents. But even that sum was more
than he could often call his own, and his fingers
closed tightly about it as if he feared that it might
somehow slip away from him and be lost. The other
packages contained powder, lead and a box of caps.
These were all useful to Godfrey, who put them into
the pocket that had the smallest holes in it, and after
replacing the pin and driving it into the hole with a
blow of his hand, walked away, well satisfied with the
discovery he had made.</p>

<p>Dan was not so smart as he thought he was. His
father had known for along time that he had a secret
hiding place for all the various little odds and ends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
that came into his hands, and when Dan went to
harness the mule, the suspicious glances he cast about
and his stealthy actions, made Godfrey believe that
he had only to watch him to find out where that
hiding place was. There was a convenient opening
in the rear wall of the cabin, that had been formed
by the &#8220;chinking&#8221; falling out, and through this hole
Godfrey watched all Dan&#8217;s movements. As long as
Dan remained at the corn-crib, Godfrey kept his eye
at the opening; but when the boy came toward the
cabin, he left it, and passing quickly across the floor
and out at the door, seated himself on the bench and
took up the position he had occupied when Dan last
saw him. When his son, satisfied with his reconnoissance,
went back to the corn-crib, Godfrey again
entered the cabin and stationing himself at the hole
in the rear wall, saw everything that was done. He
was highly delighted with the success of his little
stratagem. The money was in his possession now,
and besides he had secured ammunition enough to
last him a month.</p>

<p>&#8220;The amazin&#8217; ongrateful an&#8217; ondutiful chap, to hide
things from his poor ole dad in sich a scandalous way
as that ar,&#8221; said Godfrey, giving his pocket a slap.
&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t lend it to me to take keer of it fur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
him, an&#8217; now I&#8217;ve got it anyhow. But how came
he by it, is what I&#8217;d like to know. Don&#8217;t stand to
reason that Silas Jones give it to him, kase he hain&#8217;t
been a doin&#8217; no work for Silas&mdash;no, I&#8217;ll warrant he
hain&#8217;t. Dan takes arter his pop, and is too much
of a gentleman to do anything like work when he
can get outen it.&#8221;</p>

<p>How Dan came by the money in the first place
was a matter that interested and perplexed Godfrey
not a little. He seated himself on the bench again,
and smoked up two or three pipes of store tobacco
while he was thinking about it. But he could come
to no conclusion, although he kept his mind busy
until the creaking of the wagon wheels announced
that Dan was coming back. Then Godfrey had other
matters to think of. He expected a stormy scene
with his son when the latter discovered that his money
had been removed from its hiding place, and he prepared
for it by going into the cabin and placing the
rawhide where he could find it at a moment&#8217;s warning.
Then he pushed back his sleeves, seated his remnant
of a hat firmly on his head, and seated himself on the
bench again to await Dan&#8217;s approach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer mam hain&#8217;t come hum yet, Dannie,&#8221; said
he, when the boy had arrived within speaking distance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
&#8220;She&#8217;s allers away when she&#8217;d oughter be here
tidyin&#8217; up things, an&#8217; makin&#8217; the house look as though
white folks lived here; but we won&#8217;t wait fur her.
Ye can cook as well as any woman, Dannie, an&#8217; we&#8217;ll
have some of that fresh meat to onct.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan made no reply in words. He put his hand
into his pocket and looked at his father; whereupon
the latter arose and glanced into the wagon. It was
empty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whar&#8217;s the meat?&#8221; he demanded, angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s done sold,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>For a moment Godfrey acted as if he were about
to go off into an awful passion. He spread out his
feet, clenched both his hands and began shaking them
in the air. Then he jumped up, knocked his heels
together, and having thus loosened his joints, was
ready for action. Dan saw that the storm was coming,
and made all haste to put himself out of the way of
its fury, first by jumping out of the wagon on the
opposite side, so that he would have a fair chance to
run if he found it necessary, and second by trying to
appease his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hain&#8217;t that the way to get rich, pop,&mdash;by takin&#8217;
money every chance ye get?&#8221; said he. &#8220;I got it
an&#8217; I saved it, too. Look a yer,&#8221; he added, pulling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
some bills out of his pocket, and extending them
across the wagon toward his father.</p>

<p>Godfrey was mollified at once. The sight of money
always made him good-natured, especially if he saw
a prospect of handling it himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much ye got thar?&#8221; he asked, in a very
different tone of voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three dollars an&#8217; a half,&#8221; replied Dan. &#8220;Silas
Jones done offered it to me fur my beef, an&#8217; when I
axed him whar was the money, he counted it right
down. Mebbe I could lend ye another dollar, pop,
if ye&#8217;ll promise to pay it back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Godfrey had in some way collected his wandering
wits by this time. He reviewed the situation hastily
while Dan was speaking, and greatly to the surprise
of the boy, who had never known him to refuse money
before, replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Dannie, the money is yourn, an&#8217; I wont take
it from ye. I&#8217;ll have plenty of my own in a week
or two&mdash;jest as soon as we find that thar bar&#8217;l. But,
Dannie, I had got my mind all made up fur somethin&#8217;
nice, an&#8217; I can&#8217;t no ways do without some fresh meat
of some kind fur supper; so if ye&#8217;ll take yer rifle an&#8217;
go right out an&#8217; shoot some squirrels, I&#8217;ll say no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
more about yer sellin&#8217; the meat. I&#8217;ll unhitch the
critter, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan, glad to be let off so easily, and wondering
greatly at this unusual display of forbearance on the
part of his father, readily agreed to this proposal.
But he didn&#8217;t quite like the look of things. He had
a suspicion that this was simply a ruse on the part
of his father, and that when he came out from behind
the wagon and entered the cabin to get his rifle, Godfrey
would seize him and bring the rawhide into play.
Experience had taught him that his father&#8217;s word
was not always to be depended on, so he was very
cautious in his movements. He accompanied the
wagon to the corn-crib, waited until his father began
to unharness the mule, and then darted into the cabin,
secured his rifle and ammunition, and quickly put a
ten rail fence between him and his sire. Then he
began to breathe easier.</p>

<p>Being left to himself, Godfrey proceeded very leisurely
to unharness the mule and detach him from the
wagon. Just as the work was about to be completed,
he heard the report of his son&#8217;s rifle away off in the
woods. The sound had a strange effect upon him.
His actions seemed to say that he had been waiting
for it. Quickly dropping the harness, which he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
on the point of hanging in its accustomed place, he
seized the wooden pin that concealed the entrance to
Dan&#8217;s hiding-place, and pulled it out. Then he took
the packages from his pocket, one by one, and put
them back in the opening just as he had found them&mdash;the
powder first, the lead next, then the caps, and
lastly the money; and when they were all in, he
drove the pin back to its place and hung the harness
upon it. He seemed to feel relieved after it was
done. He drew a long breath, and started for the
cabin to solace himself with a pipe, as he always did
after he had exerted himself in any unusual degree.</p>

<p>In half an hour the sun began to sink behind the
trees on the opposite bank of the river, and then
Godfrey&#8217;s scattered family began to come in, one after
the other. First came his wife, who had been over
to see a neighbor with whom she had been on visiting
terms in better days. On her arm she carried a
basket covered with a snow-white napkin. Godfrey&#8217;s
eyes glistened at the sight of it. He had seen a good
many such baskets carried into his house of late, and
he knew that every time they came he and the rest
of the family had something good to eat for a day or
two.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Godfrey, if you will chop some wood and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
start a fire, I&#8217;ll get some supper,&#8221; said his wife,
cheerfully.</p>

<p>The man took his pipe out of his mouth and
groaned. Chopping wood was his pet aversion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t used to be so in the good ole days, did it,
Susie?&#8221; said he, with a long-drawn sigh. &#8220;I used
to have plenty of niggers to do that ar mean work.
Choppin&#8217; wood ain&#8217;t gentleman&#8217;s work, Susie&mdash;no
it ain&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But somebody must do it, Godfrey,&#8221; said Mrs.
Evans.</p>

<p>&#8220;So they must; but I can&#8217;t seem to stoop to it,
somehow. Here comes Dave. Make him do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;David is tired out, most likely. He&#8217;s been
tramping through the fields all the afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; hain&#8217;t I tired out too, I&#8217;d like to know?&#8221;
exclaimed Godfrey. &#8220;Here I&#8217;ve been an&#8217; hoofed it
down to the landin&#8217; an&#8217; worked like a good fellow at
that shootin&#8217; match. Whew! It jest makes me ache
all over to think of all I&#8217;ve been an&#8217; done since
dinner. &#8217;Sides, Dave&#8217;s got no sort o&#8217; right to go a
trampin&#8217; &#8217;round the fields all the arternoon. He&#8217;d
oughter be to hum straightenin&#8217; up things. But it
won&#8217;t be so long&mdash;not longer nor next week, nohow&mdash;kase
that thar bar&#8217;l will&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>&#8220;Now, Godfrey!&#8221; interrupted Mrs. Evans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, ole woman!&#8221; retorted Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you didn&#8217;t mean what you said to-day at
the dinner table,&#8221; said his wife, &#8220;and I wish you
wouldn&#8217;t talk so before the boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About that thar bar&#8217;l, with the eighty thousand
dollars into it? I did mean it, an&#8217; I tell ye I will
talk so, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is high time somebody was taking charge
of your children. David may be able to resist such
temptations, but I don&#8217;t want to have him put to the
test. You will certainly have a bad influence over
Dan, for you will make him dishonest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mere mention of that word seemed to irritate
Godfrey. He jumped up from the bench, spread out
his feet, and taking his pipe from his mouth with
one hand, extended the other toward his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, ole woman, jest look at ye!&#8221; he began;
and then he bounded into the air, knocked his heels
together, and came down on his feet again with a jar
that must have shaken him all over. &#8220;An&#8217; now jest
look at me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was talking with Mrs. Gordon about it not
more than an hour ago,&#8221; said Mrs. Evans, not at all
alarmed by her husband&#8217;s words or actions. &#8220;She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
says the general wants to do something for David,
and will use his influence to put him where he can
make a man of himself. He has aspirations, and I
believe will be of some use in the world if he ever
has the chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Godfrey put his pipe back into his mouth and sat
down again.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say them things is that Dave&#8217;s
got?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aspirations,&#8221; replied Mrs. Evans.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s them, an&#8217; whar did he get &#8217;em?&#8221; inquired
Godfrey, who thought they might be something of
value which David carried in his pockets, and which
might be stolen after the boy had gone to bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that he doesn&#8217;t want to live in this way
all his life. He wants to do and be something
better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Godfrey, somewhat disappointed.
&#8220;Wal, I can take keer of him, an&#8217; without no help
from the gen&#8217;ral, who can jest watch his own boys
an&#8217; let mine be. That bar&#8217;l will fix things all right!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Evans, seeing that nothing was to be gained
by talking to her husband, passed on into the cabin;
and just then David came up. He carried his old
single-barrel shot gun over his shoulder, a bunch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
quails in his hand, and Don Gordon&#8217;s pointer followed
close at his heels, his appearance indicating
that he had been doing some work since he left the
cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, sonny,&#8221; said Godfrey, &#8220;how does the pup
understand his business?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, it will be no trouble at all to break him,&#8221;
answered David. &#8220;He understands some things as
well as an old dog already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear ye say so, an&#8217; I&#8217;m glad to see
ye&#8217;ve done so well,&#8221; said Godfrey, glancing at the
bunch of quails. &#8220;Ye&#8217;re getting to be a right smart
hunter. Ye can make a good livin&#8217; at it some day,
if ye want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to,&#8221; said David quickly. &#8220;I
can make a better living at something else, and take
care of my mother, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, sonny. Allers think of yer mam,
what&#8217;s done so much fur ye; an&#8217; of yer pop, too.
He&#8217;s worked monstrous hard to edicate ye an&#8217; keep
a roof over yer head, yer pop has, an&#8217; ye&#8217;d oughter
to begin to pay him back purty soon. Now, put
away yer gun an&#8217; go an&#8217; chop some wood fur yer
mam to cook supper by. She&#8217;s tired, an&#8217; so be I.
We&#8217;ve worked powerful hard this arternoon, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
have, while ye&#8217;ve been trampin&#8217; about enjoyin&#8217;
yerself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Godfrey settled back on the bench and gave his
undivided attention to his pipe for a few seconds and
then suddenly arose and entered the cabin. He had
counted the moments of Dan&#8217;s absence pretty closely
and knew about what time to look for his return.
He knew, too, what the boy would do first when he
came back, and wanted to be where he could watch
all his movements. He applied his eye to the hole
in the wall where the chinking had fallen out, and
was just in time to see Dan climb the fence that
separated the woods from the little clearing in which
the cabin stood, and make his way towards the corn-crib.
When he reached it he paused long enough to
make sure that there was no one in sight, and then
quickly took the harness down from its place, and
pulled out the pin. A hasty glance at the interior
of his hiding place, satisfied him that everything was
just as he had left it; and this being settled he
pulled something out of his pocket, pushed it into
the opening, replaced the pin, and hung up the
harness, just as David, with an axe on his shoulder,
came whistling around the corner of the cabin.</p>

<p>Having seen all he wanted to see, Godfrey quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
crossed the cabin and seating himself on the bench
pulled vigorously at his pipe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fur downright Yankee &#8217;cuteness an&#8217; smartness
I jist think I lay over &#8217;most anybody,&#8221; thought he,
giving his knee an approving slap. &#8220;I&#8217;m jist three
dollars an&#8217; a half ahead of what I would have been,
if I had kept that money when I had it. When Dan
told me that he&#8217;d done sold that beef, I knowed what
he&#8217;d do with the money, an&#8217; that&#8217;s why I sent him
into the woods arter them squirrels. It give me time
to fix things in that hole jist as I found &#8217;em, an&#8217; now
Dan&#8217;s done gone an&#8217; put that three an&#8217; a half in there
too, which makes me a&#8217;most seven dollars ahead of
the hounds, if I counted it up on my fingers right,
an&#8217; I reckon I did. I hain&#8217;t agoin&#8217; to hunt fur that
bar&#8217;l to-night, kase when Dan goes to sleep I want
to slip out thar an&#8217; get that money, afore he has a
chance to take it out an&#8217; put it sowewhar else!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment Dan came around the corner of
the cabin, with a string of squirrels thrown over his
shoulder. There were eight of them altogether and
he held them up so that his father could see that
every one of them was shot through the head. Godfrey
complimented him on his skill, and when the
boy passed into the cabin became suddenly silent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
thoughtful. A question had just occurred to him.
What if Dan had spent some of the money at the
landing before he came home? He could not breathe
freely until he found out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; said he, as the boy, having put away
his rifle, came out again and seated himself on a log
near the cabin preparatory to skinning the squirrels
he had shot, &#8220;ye told me ye&#8217;d got&mdash;&mdash;how much
fur that quarter of beef?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three an&#8217; a half, pop,&#8221; was the reply, and Dan
began to look wild, and arose rather hastily from the
log. There was something in the tone in which this
question was propounded that made him fear that
the storm he had quelled a short time before, was
gathering again; but his father&#8217;s next words reassured
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer a good son, Dannie,&#8221; said Godfrey. &#8220;An&#8217;
that&#8217;s the way to get rich, that ar way is. Take
money when ye can get it, an&#8217; <i>keep</i> it, too; mind
that, Dannie. Don&#8217;t go to throwin&#8217; it about loose
an&#8217; reckless, but hold fast to it with sich a grip that
nothin&#8217; can&#8217;t make ye let up. Ye didn&#8217;t spend none
of it at the landin&#8217;, I hope?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t. Didn&#8217;t I tell ye that I brung
every cent of it hum?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good boy,&#8221; said Godfrey; and having
set his fears at rest, he became silent again and puffed
at his pipe until he was called to supper. When the
meal was over, he went back to his pipe again; Dan
made a pretence of chopping wood; while David
assisted his mother in her household duties. It began
to grow dark at last, and then Dan threw down
his axe and seated himself beside his father who was
nodding on the bench.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, pop, be we goin&#8217; to look fur that bar&#8217;l to-night?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Dannie, we hain&#8217;t,&#8221; was the sleepy reply.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t. Here I&#8217;ve been an&#8217; hoofed it down to the
landin&#8217; an&#8217; back since dinner, an&#8217; I&#8217;m jest teetotally
tuckered out. Wait till to-morrow an&#8217; then we&#8217;ll
go!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan was surprised at this answer. He was tired
himself, but the prospect of digging up eighty
thousand dollars in gold and silver, would have put
life and energy into him if he had been completely
exhausted. He attributed his father&#8217;s refusal to his
inherent laziness; but something he discovered the
next morning showed him that he was wrong there.</p>

<p>The evening was passed in much the same manner
that every evening was passed under Godfrey&#8217;s roof.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
There were no candles to light the hovel, and even
if there had been there were no books or papers to
read, no games or anything else to engage in to make
the time pass pleasantly. In one corner of the cabin
beside the fire-place was a pile of resinous knots
which David had picked up in the woods. One of
these was occasionally placed on the coals, and while
it blazed up and threw a feeble light about the room,
David and his mother talked of the past and speculated
concerning the future. This was the way
David&#8217;s education had always been conducted. The
remembrance of these evening interviews with his
mother went through life with him, and the moral
lessons that were then inculcated stood him in good
hand in after years.</p>

<p>Dan and his father had their own peculiar ways
of putting in the time that elapsed between the
cleaning away of the supper dishes and the hour for
retiring. Dan always stretched himself out on the
floor and went to sleep, while his father nodded on
the bench outside the door. On this particular
evening Godfrey did not seem to slumber very heavily
for every now and then he would straighten up and
look steadily toward the corner in which Dan lay.
He appeared to be waiting for something. It came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
at last in the shape of a gentle snore, and then Godfrey
arose and stole away in the darkness. A few
minutes later he came back, and taking possession
of the miserable &#8220;shake down&#8221; he called a bed, was
soon sound asleep.</p>

<small>OUR FRIENDS, THE GORDONS.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">READER, are you tired of Godfrey Evans and
his dismal surroundings? If you are, let us go
up to General Gordon&#8217;s, where we shall be sure of a
hearty welcome and more agreeable companionship.</p>

<p>The house in which the general and his family
now live does not look much like the noble mansion
they called home a few years ago; but it is very
neat and comfortable, and there is always room enough
under its hospitable roof to accommodate visitors,
who are greeted and entertained in good old southern
style. It stands on the spot where the old house
stood, and in the midst of extensive grounds, which
a few years ago looked like a tropical garden. They
still retain some of their old-time beauty, but yet
wear an air of neglect; and many of the rare and
valuable plants, which Mrs. Gordon and her daughters
took so much pride in cultivating and protecting
from the fury of the winter rains and sleets,
have perished for want of care, and have not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
replaced. On one side the grounds slope down to
the shores of Diamond lake&mdash;a little sheet of water
about four miles long and half a mile wide, surrounded
on three sides by a dense forest of tall trees, so heavily
draped with climbing plants, mosses and grape-vines,
that to a person seated in a boat in the middle of the
lake, it would seem to be almost impenetrable.</p>

<p>This lake is not like our northern lakes. The gravelly
beach is wanting, and so are the black bass, the
pickerel and other fine game fish that we find in our
waters. The shores are low and muddy, the banks
are thickly lined with snags, stumps and trees, and a
northern boy would look twice at the dark, slimy
water before he would think of going in bathing
there. If he made up his mind to venture, he might
think better of it if, while he was looking around for
a log to put his clothes on, he should discover a large
moccasin curled up in the edge of the water, and
closely watching all his movements. Are these
snakes poisonous? Ask Don and Bert what they
think about it. They will tell you that one day last
August, while they were sitting on the little wooden
wharf, which juts out into the lake below the summer
house, bobbing for sun-fish, they happened to look
into the water a little way from the shore, and saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
what appeared to be the head and neck of a goose
moving rapidly along. But they knew it was not
that, for summer is not the time for waterfowl down
here, and besides a goose does not swim with his body
submerged. It was a moccasin, and he was directing
his course toward a log which lay in the water about
twenty yards from the wharf. The boys knew he
was a big one, or he could not have held his head so
high above the water; but they were amazed at the
sight of the bulk he presented to view when, reaching
the log, he drew himself upon it, and stretched out
flat preparatory to taking his afternoon nap. The
longer the boys looked at him, the more their astonishment
increased; and at last Don quietly laid
down his fish-pole, and requesting his brother to
keep an eye on the reptile, arose and stole off to the
house. When he returned he carried a light breech-loading
shot gun in his hands&mdash;one of those weapons
that &#8220;break in two in the middle.&#8221; Both barrels
were loaded, and Don had two more cartridges in his
pocket for use in case the first should not prove
effectual.</p>

<p>The moccasin lay in such a position that Don could
not see his head; so he took a hasty aim at the
thickest part of his body, and fired both barrels in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
quick succession. He was so surprised at the effect
of his shot that he did not think of the cartridges he
had in his pocket. The moccasin was not killed, but
he was so badly wounded that he could not get off
the log.</p>

<p>&#8220;The end his head was on was lively enough,&#8221;
Don afterward told his father, &#8220;and whirled around
at a great rate; but the end his tail was on seemed
to be completely paralyzed, for it did not move at
all.&#8221; He made the most desperate efforts to crawl
off into the water, and failing in that, turned and bit
himself twice, and a moment afterward was dead.</p>

<p>Don leaned on his breech-loader and looked at his
brother. &#8220;That settles two things, Bert,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;One is that we have all been mistaken in supposing
that moccasins are not poisonous; and the second is,
that one must not put implicit faith in everything
he sees in books. Only yesterday I was reading in
my natural history that a scorpion, &#8216;if surrounded
by a circle of fire so that it cannot escape, will turn
and sting itself through the head, this being the only
companion of man in suicide.&#8217; This little incident
proves that man has other companions in suicide,
doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Besides these disagreeable and dangerous inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
of the lake, there are others in the shape of
alligator-gars and turtles. The latter have bills like
parrots, and grow so large and heavy that it takes
two men to lift one of them. A gar is a long, slender
fish, and but for its color, might be taken for a
gigantic pickerel. It is sometimes found eight feet
in length. People say they are harmless, but a timid
person would not care to trust one too far after looking
at its mouthful of teeth.</p>

<p>The boys have two canoes and one sail-boat in the
lake. The boat was built in St. Louis, and a steamer
brought it to the landing, where Don and Bert took
charge of it and navigated it to the wharf by way of
the Pass, which connects the lake with the river.
This Pass was for a long time blocked up by a levee
to keep the waters of the river from overflowing the
low lands about the lake. During the war it was cut
by the Union forces, and the gunboats came down
through the lake and entered Coldwater and Tallahatchee
rivers, in the effort to get behind the strong
fortifications at Haines&#8217;s Bluff.</p>

<p>Although the lake is but a poor fishing ground, it
is a splendid place for ducks and geese. About a
mile from the house, on the river side of the lake, is
a long, narrow point, which stretches almost across to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the opposite bank, and it is there that the best shooting
is to be found. As it belongs to their father the
boys have taken possession of it, and on the highest
and dryest part, erected a rough board cabin which
goes by the name of &#8220;Our Shooting-box.&#8221; It looks
dreary enough in summer, with only a rusty stove
and a few empty cupboards in it by way of furniture;
but when the &#8220;melancholy days&#8221; are come, and the
leaves begin to fall, and the autumnal winds to
whistle dismally through the branches of the forest&mdash;when
the trumpet-like notes of the first returning
flock of brant are heard, then the shooting-box opens
wide its hospitable door, and receives beneath the
shelter of its roof a company of merry youngsters,
who yearly congregate here to enjoy the splendid
shooting the lake affords. Then the bare floor is
covered with comfortable rugs, and there are camp
chairs and lounges enough to accommodate all the
young sportsmen who can crawl into the cabin. Then
the cupboards are abundantly supplied with dishes,
knives, forks and other table furniture, and everything
in the way of provisions that hungry boys can
ask for; and in the loft, which extends over half the
room, are always to be found a barrel or two of
hickory nuts, butternuts and pecans. And what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
sport the boys enjoy here in these days! A person
who has once taken part in it, will willingly go a
hundred miles to have more of it. The shooting is
all done over decoys. These decoys are pieces of
light wood shaped like ducks and geese, and painted
to resemble them. And that they do resemble the
natural bird very closely, is proved by the fact that
more than one hunter has emptied his double-barrel
into a flock of decoys and never discovered his mistake,
until the disgusted owner of the wooden birds
jumped up from behind his blind and demanded to
know what he was about.</p>

<p>These decoys are anchored off the point of which
we have spoken, and Don and Bert, and the rest of
the young hunters, hide behind their blinds&mdash;little
breastworks of bushes erected on shore&mdash;and with
their guns in their hands, hold themselves in readiness
to shoot at the first flock that comes within
range. And they are never obliged to wait long.
The wild fowl, in passing from one end of the lake to
the other, discover what they suppose to be a company
of their friends swimming in perfect security
near the shore, and stop to pay them a visit; but
just as they swing to the decoys, their ranks are
decimated by the double-barrels, and it is a lucky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
flock that gets off without leaving a dozen or more
of its number behind. The birds being gone, Don&#8217;s
pointers, which are crouching behind the blind by
their master&#8217;s side, retrieve the dead and wounded
in the most approved style; and when they are all
brought in the boys are ready for another flock.
When night comes they are sure to be very tired and
hungry, and to have as many birds as they care to
carry home. They are equally certain to find a
smoking supper waiting for them on their arrival at
the shooting-box, and old Cuff ready to receive them
with open arms.</p>

<p>During the evening they fight their battles over
again&mdash;telling of that fine shot made at such a
distance that a miss seemed certain, or that clear
miss made when the bird ought to have been easily
brought to bag&mdash;and at last go to bed to pass
through the same exciting scenes again in their
dreams. We do not blame Don and his friends for
thinking a good deal of that little shooting-box, for
we passed one of the pleasantest months of our life
there.</p>

<p>Having seen the grounds and glanced at all the
interesting things outside the house, let us go in for
a few minutes. The wide front door stands invitingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
open&mdash;there is no danger to be apprehended from
tramps and sneak-thieves in this out-of-the-way
place&mdash;and being well acquainted with all the inmates,
and feeling quite at home here, we enter without
ceremony. Passing along the hall and turning to
the left we find a second door, also standing open,
and this leads us into the apartment occupied by Don
and his brother as a sitting and school room. They
study and recite their lessons here, and when their
school duties are over, they have the room to themselves.
It is neatly furnished, and in it are many
of those things which Dan Evans seems to regard as
indispensable aids to happiness. Of course he does
not include books and papers in the list, but we think
they are very necessary, and so do Don and Bert.
Their library is small but well chosen, and made up
almost entirely of books from which they can learn
something.</p>

<p>We enter the room on the afternoon of the same
day on which Dan Evans came over to ask for five
of the ten dollars that Don had promised David for
field-breaking his young pointer. We have seen that
he got the money, and that he went away leaving
Bert reading a book. We find him engaged in the
same pleasing occupation. He reads for a few minutes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
and then placing the book on his knee, gazes
thoughtfully out at the trees in the yard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why it can&#8217;t be done,&#8221; he says, to
himself. &#8220;Father has a light spring wagon that I
know he would let us take, and we have two good
ponies to draw it. We couldn&#8217;t put up at a hotel while
we are gone, but who cares for that? We own a good
tent, and if we should take old Cuff along to act as
cook and camp-keeper, we could live as well as we
do at home or at the shooting-box.&#8221;</p>

<p>The book Bert has been reading, and which suggests
this train of thought, is Frank Forester&#8217;s &#8220;Deer
Stalkers.&#8221; It tells how Harry Archer and two
companions went on a deer hunt somewhere in the
state of New York, and how they enjoyed themselves.
It is one of Don&#8217;s favorite books; and the reason
Bert reads it to-day is because it happened to be the
first one he picked up when he came into the room.
While he read the thought occurred to him that if
he and his brother should follow in the lead of the
heroes of the book, they could spend a few days very
pleasantly. They had everything needful for a
week&#8217;s sojourn in the woods, or a month&#8217;s, and a trip
like that would just suit Don. Their school term
would be over in a week&mdash;their tutor was going north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
to spend the holidays with his friends&mdash;and Don,
who had grown very fond of him and of his books,
wondered how he was going to pass the time during
his absence. Of course there was the shooting-box,
but one does not care to spend two whole months in
duck hunting, and Don had often been heard to
declare that he wished he could go somewhere and
spend a week as he had never spent one before.
Bert thought he had hit upon something that would
please him. He had heard wonderful reports of late
of the abundance of game to be found in an adjoining
county, forty miles away. Deer were so plenty that
they had been seen in the corn-fields; a bear had
been known to approach a lonely farm house in broad
daylight and walk off with a pig; and one day a
hunter, who was roaming the woods with his pack
of hounds, encountered some animal in a dense cane-brake
which almost annihilated his dogs, and made
off before the hunter could shoot him. The man did
not know what sort of an animal it was, for the cane
was so thick that he could not see him; but there
was only one thing in that part of the country that
could whip out a pack of hounds so easily and completely,
and that was a panther. Bert did not like
the idea of encountering such game as this, but Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
would not have hesitated a minute. Besides being
famous as a wing shot, and being very fond of the
breech-loader which created such havoc among the
ducks, snipe and quails, he took care to have it known
that he had bagged nobler game; and when he exhibited
the old-fashioned muzzle loading rifle which
his father had given him, and with which he had
brought down his first deer, he never forgot to mention
that four very fine bucks and one two year old
bear had fallen to that same gun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don would make a capital Harry Archer,&#8221; said
Bert, continuing the soliloquy we have interrupted,
&#8220;he is so fearless and enthusiastic. Old Cuff would
make a very good Jim Matlock&mdash;he&#8217;s black, but still
he&#8217;ll do&mdash;and instead of Smoke, the Scotch greyhound
that could perform such wonders in the way of running
and pulling down deer, we shall have, if we
have a mind to take them with us, six of the best
hounds that ever came from Kentucky. There&#8217;ll be
nothing wanting, unless it be a Harry Barhyte or a
Ned Wheeler to get us into some sort of a scrape.
If they should turn up, it would make it all the more
interesting for Don. The thought of meeting one of
the panthers, which they say are plenty in the cane-brakes,
is not a very pleasant one, and almost makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
me say that I will stay at home; but, now that I
come to think of it, we need not camp out an hour
unless we please. Bob Harrington lives over there,
in the very midst of the wilderness, and we&#8217;d be welcome
at his house as long as we chose to stop with him.
Halloa!&#8221; he added aloud, as a step was heard in the
hall, and his brother came rapidly into the room.
&#8220;I was just thinking about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re always thinking of somebody besides
yourself,&#8221; replied Don, drawing a chair to his brother&#8217;s
side and flourishing a letter which he held in his
hand. &#8220;Your face tells me that you have something
pleasant on your mind: what is it? Let us have
all the sunshine we can, for the clouds are coming&mdash;one
cloud at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Bert, who thought
by the scowl on his brother&#8217;s face that the clouds had
come already, &#8220;and whom is that letter from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us have the good news first,&#8221; replied Don,
putting the letter behind his chair, as his brother
reached out his hand to take it. &#8220;This will keep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So will the other; but since you are so determined,
I suppose I shall have to tell you. When
our tutor goes away next week we shall have two
whole months to ourselves, and instead of spending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
all the time at the shooting-box, I propose that some
fine morning we put the ponies to the spring wagon,
take our tent, one of our canoes and everything else
we need for camping out, and spend a week or so on
Coldwater.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Among the deer and bears!&#8221; exclaimed Don.
&#8220;That would be just the idea, if we could only carry
it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why can&#8217;t we carry it out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because we are not going to have those two
months all to ourselves; and besides, one of the two
fellows who is about to intrude his most unwelcome
presence upon us, is not such a boy as we should like
to have in our camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Bert.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can best answer that question by reading a
portion of this letter,&#8221; replied Don. &#8220;It came more
than a week ago. Father and mother have consulted
about it, and have finally consented, most reluctantly,
to accept the proposition it contains. I am afraid it
was a bad day for us when they did so. Our fun is
all knocked in the head. In the first place the letter
is from Uncle Bob, and relates to our cousins, Clarence
and Marshall Gordon.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>&#8220;Are they coming here?&#8221; asked Bert, his face
brightening with joyous anticipation.</p>

<p>Don looked sharply at his brother for a minute or
two before he spoke. &#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re coming,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you may think about it,
but I am sorry; and so are father and mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why do they let them come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because they can&#8217;t help it. Father is under
heavy obligations to Uncle Bob, who has done him
numberless good turns, and he says he can&#8217;t well refuse
to grant this, the only favor that Uncle Bob has
ever asked of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why don&#8217;t they want Clarence and Marshall
here?&#8221; asked Bert, who could not see why his parents
should object to the visit of relatives whom he and
his brother had not seen for many years&mdash;so many,
in fact, that he could not remember of ever having
met them at all. They (that is, Clarence and Marshall)
had always lived with their parents in Europe;
and it was only about a year ago that they had taken
up their abode in a northern city where their father
was engaged in business.</p>

<p>&#8220;This will explain everything,&#8221; said Don; and
as he spoke, he settled back in his chair and opened
the letter.</p>

<small>THE NEW COMERS.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THAT portion of the letter which Don read was
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now I come to the matter about which I
sat down to write to you. It relates to my two boys,
Clarence and Marshall&mdash;more particularly to the
first. I am very anxious to remove them both from
the temptations to which they are exposed in this
big city. Since we returned from Europe they have
been a source of constant anxiety to their mother and
myself. The first thing they did was to make
acquaintances and friends among those I should not
have chosen for their companions, if I had had the
power of selection in my own hands. Being completely
engrossed in the cares of business, I could
not give the attention to their training that I ought
to have done; and the first thing that brought me
to a sense of my duty and my neglect in this matter,
was the visit of a police officer, who called at my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
office, and informed me that Clarence had been
arrested in a saloon for engaging in a brawl over a
game of cards&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gracious!&#8221; gasped Bert.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, he&#8217;s a nice bird,&#8221; said Don, in great disgust.
&#8220;And that isn&#8217;t the worst of it. He is untruthful
and dishonest. His father doesn&#8217;t say so, but you
can gain that idea from the language he uses. Listen
to this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;For engaging in a brawl over a game of cards,
and that he would be held until his examination came
off, unless I was willing to go his bail.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means that if his father did not give bonds
for his appearance when he was wanted, he would be
put into a cell and locked up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got him out of the scrape,&#8221; the letter went on,
&#8220;and when I came to inquire into his past life I
found that his record was not such an one as a father
could be proud of. I took him out of school and
placed him in my office where he still is; but I fear
I have thrown him directly in the way of temptation
instead of taking him out of it. He has begun to
develop traits which I did not suppose he possessed,
and which lead me to distrust his every word and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
act. I cannot put the least faith in him. He cares
for nothing in the world but money, and when he
gets it, it goes for cigars, lager beer and clothes.
Marshall is not very badly contaminated as yet, but
he is so easily influenced that I fear for his future, unless
he is speedily removed from these surroundings.
Now, can you take these two boys and take care of
them for the winter, or until I can make some permanent
arrangements for them? If I had had my
way, I should have sent Clarence to sea six months
ago, for I believe that a little wholesome discipline
would make a great change in him; but his mother
will not listen to it. Something, however, must be
done at once. They are both worth saving, and I
hope that an acquaintance with Don and Bert, who, I
am told, are all that sons should be (Don blushed when
he read this, for he could not forget that wrong act
that had resulted in his expulsion from the academy),
and daily intercourse with them will show my boys
that there is something attractive in an upright,
honorable life.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>This was all. The general&#8217;s brother was a man
of few words, and as this was a subject he did not
like to dwell upon, he hurried through with it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
quickly as possible. He evidently wanted that the
general should know just what sort of boys he would
open his doors to, if he agreed to accept the responsibility
urged upon him, but, at the same time, he was
anxious that the delinquents should appear in as
favorable a light as possible, and so did not say more
than he thought to be absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am sorry they are coming,&#8221; said Bert,
as Don folded the letter and placed it in the envelope.</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; said Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;The idea of a great big, hulking, beer-drinking,
tobacco-smoking, and card-playing boy loafing about
our house,&#8221; continued Bert, betrayed by his excitement
into using stronger language than he generally
employed, and thinking of Godfrey Evans as he spoke.
&#8220;I wonder how he became so far gone before his
parents found it out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So did I&mdash;but father explained it to me&mdash;or rather
to mother, and I overheard it. He says Uncle Robert
sees but little of his family on any day except
Sundays. He leaves home early in the morning,
and does not return again until nine or ten o&#8217;clock
at night. The management of the boys is left entirely
to their mother, who doesn&#8217;t care what they do, so
long as they keep out of the way and don&#8217;t trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
her. As one can&#8217;t see to them, and the other won&#8217;t,
they have been entirely neglected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this letter has been here a week and we
never knew it,&#8221; said Bert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and a good deal longer than that,&#8221; said
Don; &#8220;long enough for the matter to be considered,
a favorable answer to be returned, and a second letter
to be received from Uncle Bob. That letter states
that the boys left Cincinnati on the Emma Deane;
and father has just learned from Mr. Jones that she
is due at our landing some time to-night or early
to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bert was sorry that the new-comers were expected
so soon. He had hoped to have a week or two in
which to think about them, and make up his mind
how he would act after they arrived. Although these
cousins were the sons of their father&#8217;s only brother,
they were utter strangers to Don and Bert. Their
parents said they had seen them once, but as they
were only three years old at the time, they could not
be expected to remember much about them. Since
then Clarence and Marshall had lived altogether in
Europe, and Don and Bert had not heard from them
on an average of once a year.</p>

<p>&#8220;I too am sorry that they are coming so soon,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
said Don, who could tell by the expression of
Bert&#8217;s face what was passing in his mind. &#8220;You
see now why your idea of a trip to Coldwater must
be given up, at least until we know more about our
expected friends. At first father thought he would
not say anything to us about the contents of this
letter, for he did not want to prejudice us against
Clarence and Marshall; but afterward he decided
that we ought to know what sort of fellows they are,
so that we may be on our guard. We are going to
have a long talk about it this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>And they did, and the whole family was present.
It was a kind of council in which the matter was
thoroughly discussed, and plans laid for the reception
of the expected visitors. The general explained why
he did not feel at liberty to refuse his brother&#8217;s request&mdash;this
being a private matter is something in
which we have no interest&mdash;and urged upon his boys
the necessity of regulating their own conduct, so that
Clarence and his brother might see that there was
more happiness, and much more respectability in a
sober, well-regulated course of life, than in the career
upon which they seemed to have entered. The new-comers,
he was sorry to say, had a great many bad
habits, and their father hoped that by sending them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
into the country for a season they might forget some
of them, and by being brought under better influences,
be finally led to see the folly of them and induced to
abandon them altogether. One thing was certain,
the general said: there was no dram-shop in the
neighborhood, not even at the landing, and beer-drinking
and card-playing were two practices that
Clarence would have to forego so long as he remained
in that part of the country. Tobacco was plenty,
but it was not at all likely that a boy who had been
in the habit of buying cigars worth ten and perhaps
twenty-five cents apiece, would stoop to a cob-pipe and
plug &#8220;Varginy.&#8221; Besides he was to have no money,
so his father said, not a cent; and taking it altogether,
it seemed as if Clarence must turn over a new leaf
while he was under his uncle&#8217;s roof, whether he
wanted to do so or not.</p>

<p>In regard to Marshall, the younger brother, the
general had not much to say, for his father had
scarcely mentioned him in his letters. But he inferred
that he was following in the footsteps of
Clarence, and that, being easily led in any direction,
there might be some hope for him if he were taken
in hand at once.</p>

<p>The unlooked-for intrusion of these discordant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
elements upon their quiet, happy family circle,
afforded the boys something to talk about that night,
and kept them awake long after they ought to have
been asleep. Bert did not take it quite so much to
heart after the first surprise was over. Indeed he
hoped that the visit might prove both pleasant and
profitable to all concerned. Clarence and Marshall
were his cousins, and Bert had a warm place in his
heart for them, even if they were not just such boys
as he would have chosen for his companions. Don,
on the other hand, took but little pains to conceal
the annoyance he felt. Cousin or no cousin, he did
not want such a companion as he knew Clarence
would prove to be, and he hoped his uncle Robert
would hurry and make up his mind to something, so
that his visit might be brought to an end as speedily
as possible. The expected visitors broke in on his
arrangements in a way he did not like. It brought
his school term to an end a week sooner than it ought
to have been ended. Of course it would not be polite
to leave Clarence and Marshall to themselves when
they arrived, and in order to give Don and Bert
an opportunity to make things pleasant for them,
the general decided that the school should close at
once.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>Morning came at last, and immediately after breakfast
the heavy, old-fashioned family carriage was
drawn to the door by a span of splendid iron-gray
horses, the tutor&#8217;s trunk was strapped on behind, and
he, in company with the general and his two boys,
stepped in, and the carriage was driven to the landing.
Just as they arrived there, a steamer appeared
in the bend, heading up the river. The general signalled
to her with his handkerchief, and she landed,
took the tutor and his luggage aboard, and continued
on her way. The boys watched her in silence until
she disappeared around the point. They had grown
to like their tutor, and were sorry to see him go;
but it was some consolation to them to know that the
separation would not be a long one.</p>

<p>The Gray Eagle&mdash;that was the name of the
steamer that took the tutor away&mdash;having disappeared,
the boys turned their attention to a thick
cloud of smoke farther up the river, and behind a
point which jutted out from the right bank. Silas
Jones, who was at the landing and expecting goods
by the first steamer from Memphis, told the general
that the Gray Eagle was the only packet that had
gone up the river since midnight, so the boys knew
that the smoke they were looking at must come from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the chimneys of some steamer bound to New Orleans.
They watched the cloud as it moved slowly along
above the trees, and finally at the end of an hour a
side-wheel steamer suddenly made her appearance in
the bend.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the Emmy Deane,&#8221; said a well-known
voice.</p>

<p>The boys turned and saw Godfrey Evans standing
close behind them. He was barefooted as usual, and
carried his rifle on his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know it is the Emma Deane?&#8221; asked
Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! mornin&#8217;, Mr. Don,&#8221; exclaimed Godfrey.
&#8220;Proud to see ye, sar. How&#8217;s all the folks? Mine
is only jest tol&#8217;able, thank ye, &#8217;ceptin&#8217; the ole woman,
an&#8217; she&#8217;s poorly. How do I know that&#8217;s the Emmy
Deane? Kase I know it is, an&#8217; I can tell a&#8217;most
every boat on the river that stops here, too. When
she whistles, ye&#8217;ll see she&#8217;s got four&mdash;two high up
an&#8217; two low down. Mr. Don,&#8221; added Godfrey, lowering
his voice, &#8220;can I see ye jest a minute, please,
sar?&#8221;</p>

<p>Don, wondering what business Godfrey could have
with him, which was of so private a nature that it
could not be spoken of in the hearing of his father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
and brother, drew off on one side, and the man, after
clearing his throat, continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re powerful poor folks, Mr. Don, an&#8217; the ole
woman she was tuk down with the fever &#8217;n&#8217; ager
last night, an&#8217; done shook the roof clean off&#8217;n the
house; an&#8217; Dave, he hain&#8217;t got a shoe to bless hisself
with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Don, when Godfrey paused and
looked at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, Dave, he wants me to ax ye, Mr. Don,
please sar, would ye mind givin&#8217; him five dollars this
mornin&#8217;, sar, kase ye know ye promised him ten fur
breakin&#8217; that pinter pup, an&#8217; we&#8217;re powerful poor
folks, ye know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I&#8217;ll give it to him,&#8221; replied Don,
quickly. &#8220;He can have it at any time for the asking.
I would have given it to him yesterday if I
had known that he wanted it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, he didn&#8217;t want it yesterday, an&#8217; he wouldn&#8217;t
a wanted it to-day, only the ole woman&#8217;s got the
fever &#8217;n&#8217; ager, an&#8217; we&#8217;s so poor. He told me to ax
ye would ye give it to me, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll give it to him,
please, sar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don readily consented to this. He produced his
pocket-book and handed the five dollars to Godfrey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
who clutched the money and made off with it in such
haste that Don looked at him in great surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he want of you?&#8221; asked Bert, when
his brother came back to the carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wanted some of the money I promised David
for breaking that pointer,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, that reminds me,&#8221; said Bert. &#8220;How much
did you give him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave him half of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I gave him the other half yesterday, so
David is paid up in full, and you owe mother five
dollars. Dan dunned me, and I borrowed the money
to give him. He came over to see you, but as you
were not at home, I acted in your place. Was that
right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly. I told David he could have the money
whenever he wanted it. I am somewhat surprised,
though, for I understood him to say that he intended
to keep some of it to send off those quails with.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this while the steamer had been approaching
the landing, and the nearer she came, the more certain
did the people, who were standing around, declare
themselves to be that it was the Emma Deane. At
last she whistled, and there proved to be &#8220;two high
up and two low down;&#8221; in other words, there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
four whistles, and being attached to the same steam-pipe,
of course they all sounded at once&mdash;two uttering
notes high up on the musical scale, and the others
emitting a deep bass. Then all doubts, if any remained,
were cleared away. She was the Emma
Deane, and she was going to land. This she did a
few minutes afterward. The moment her bow touched
the shore, a deck-hand sprang out with a line which
he made fast to a convenient tree; a staging was
pushed ashore, and the crew began bringing out the
goods Silas Jones was expecting from Memphis.
The boys ran their eyes over the passengers who
were crowded on her boiler-deck, while the general
at once made his way on board to hunt up his
nephews. He returned about five minutes later, followed
by two gentlemanly-looking youths, and these
in turn were followed by a negro porter who carried
a heavy trunk on his shoulder.</p>

<p>It is hard to tell just what sort of fellows Don
expected to see, but it was plain from the expression
on his face, and the manner in which he passed
through the ceremony of introduction, that he was
surprised, to say the least; while Bert&#8217;s bewilderment
was too palpable to escape notice. The latter knew
but little of the world, and had somehow got it into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
his head that vices of every description came in shapes
so easy to be recognised, that any one would know
them. When he heard that his cousin Clarence was
in the habit of using tobacco and playing cards, he
put him down as a lazy, good-for-nothing fellow, much
of the same stamp as Godfrey Evans; but here was
a dashing youth, dressed in the latest fashion, who
looked as though he might know a thing or two, and
who conducted himself in an easy, off-hand manner,
that, to diffident little Bert, was perfectly charming.
He resembled Godfrey Evans in about the same degree
that his own father did. He appeared to be as much
at ease as though he had come among friends with
whom he had long been acquainted, and his younger
brother, Marshall, was not a whit behind him in this
respect; while Bert could not say a word in response
to their polite and cordial greeting, and even Don,
who was usually self-possessed, hesitated and blushed
and looked as embarrassed as though he had been
caught in some act of mischief.</p>

<p>The introduction being over, the trunk was strapped
in its place behind the carriage, our party all got in,
and Don picked up the reins and drove homeward.
On the way Don and Bert had leisure to collect their
wits a little, and while doing their part toward maintaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the conversation that followed, devoted themselves
principally to making a mental estimate of
their visitors&mdash;a proceeding on their part which was
closely imitated by Clarence and Marshall. What
results they arrived at perhaps we shall see by and
by.</p>

<p>Clarence would have attracted attention almost anywhere.
He was a handsome fellow, and the ease and
readiness with which he expressed himself in conversation,
astonished Don, who was himself blessed with
more than an ordinary command of language. He
described with great fluency and animation several
interesting and amusing incidents that had fallen under
his notice during the journey from Cincinnati, and
seemed to be so well posted in every subject that came
up for discussion, and yet so modest, that Don began
to accuse himself of having been guilty of a very
ungenerous act, in that he had allowed himself to
become prejudiced against his cousin before he saw
him. He told himself that he would have in him a
most agreeable companion, and one from whom he
could learn something.</p>

<p>Bert formed nearly the same opinion of Marshall.
These two sat on the back seat while the rest of the
party occupied the one in front, and being left in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
great measure to themselves, imagined by the time
they reached home, that they had had opportunity
to become well acquainted. They found out not a
few of each other&#8217;s likes and dislikes, and were both
pleased to learn that they had many ideas in common.
Marshall liked to fish and hunt occasionally, but he
liked a game of chess or checkers better, and cards
and billiards better than anything. He opened his
eyes when he learned that Bert had never seen a
billiard table, and that he did not know one card
from another. He, Marshall, had been accustomed
to these things all his life, he said, but he thought
he could get on very well without them. His mother
wanted him to give them up, and he was going to do
it to please her. He seemed to think a good deal of
his mother, and Bert told himself that that was a
redeeming trait, and would do much toward bringing
him out all right in the end.</p>

<p>The party reached home in due time, and found
Mrs. Gordon and her daughters waiting to receive
them. The visitors were cordially welcomed, and
after a short visit in the parlor, were shown to their
room and left to themselves. As soon as Clarence
had closed and locked the door, he threw himself into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the nearest chair with the air of one who was badly
bored and utterly disgusted.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you like it as far as you have gone?&#8221;
asked Marshall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it at all,&#8221; was the reply; &#8220;and it
has gone about as far as it will with me, too. If the
old man thinks I am going to vegetate down here for
the next six months, he is badly mistaken. I won&#8217;t
do it to please anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t help yourself,&#8221; said his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t! I&#8217;ll show you that I can. I&#8217;ll write a
letter to mother this very night, and tell her that I
want money enough to take me home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, of course that will bring it,&#8221; said Marshall,
with a laugh which said that he thought it would not.
&#8220;You know what father said the last thing before
we left, don&#8217;t you&mdash;that we need not write for money,
because we couldn&#8217;t have a cent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know, but I&#8217;ll get it, all the same. See
there,&#8221; said Clarence, exhibiting almost a handful
of small change.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get that?&#8221; demanded his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother gave it to me just before we left home.
She said that I might want some spending money,
and hinted that when this was gone, I knew where I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
could get more. I&#8217;ll ask for more at once; and if
it doesn&#8217;t come, I&#8217;ll drop a line to mother telling her
that if she wants to see me again, she had better be
doing something. That always wakes her up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has had the desired effect so far, I admit,&#8221;
said Marshall. &#8220;But suppose father should get hold
of one of those threatening letters, and should write
back to you: &#8216;My dear Clarence: You have talked
this way often enough. You shan&#8217;t have a cent.&#8217;
What would you do then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, in the first place, there is no danger that
my letters will ever fall into his hands, for mother
takes precious good care to put them in the grate as
soon as she reads them; and in the next place, I&#8217;d
make the old man repent such an act the longest day
he lived. I&#8217;d clear out, and he&#8217;d never see me
again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, nonsense!&#8221; exclaimed Marshall, tucking up
his sleeves preparatory to plunging his hands into the
wash-bowl. &#8220;You are not the one to cut loose from
a comfortable home and go out into the world to
make your own living, as long as you can avoid it.
You like your ease altogether too well for that. Tell
us some other funny story, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no funny story about this. I am in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
earnest, and you&#8217;ll see if I don&#8217;t get the money in
less than two weeks. I can&#8217;t live down here in this
wilderness&mdash;no billiards, no theatres, no nothing
that&#8217;s interesting. How is one to kill time, I wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must read, and hunt, and fish, and ride on
horseback,&#8221; replied Marshall, in a tone of voice that
would have made Bert open his eyes if he could have
heard it. &#8220;That is the way our worthy cousins put
in their leisure moments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They must find it highly entertaining. I should
expect it of them. Did you ever see two such country
bumpkins? Wouldn&#8217;t they cut a pretty figure
in the city? Why, when we were introduced to
them they were as dumb as clams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but you&#8217;d better take advice now for once
in your life, and be very careful of your language
and your behavior when you are in the presence of
those same country bumpkins. That Don is pretty
broad-shouldered, and I notice he&#8217;s got a grip like a
young blacksmith. I found that out when I shook
hands with him. If you are as tyrannical and overbearing
with him as you are with me sometimes, you
may get yourself into business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the ringing of a bell in the hall brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Clarence to his feet. &#8220;What&#8217;s that for, I wonder?&#8221;
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dinner, most likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dinner at twelve!&#8221; said Clarence, glancing at
his watch. &#8220;And supper at six and bed at half-past
eight, I suppose!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably; and what will trouble you still more,
breakfast at six every morning,&#8221; said Marshall.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t lie in bed here till ten or eleven o&#8217;clock
and then have breakfast sent up to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence said something more about &#8220;country
bumpkins,&#8221; repeated the resolution he had so suddenly
formed that his sojourn under his uncle&#8217;s roof
should be a very short one, and then made all haste
to get ready for dinner.</p>

<small>DAN MAKES A DISCOVERY.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE next morning, long before the sun showed
himself above the tree-tops, the Evans family
were all astir. They always rose at an early hour,
and it was probably more from the force of habit than
for any other reason, for, with the exception of Mrs.
Evans, none of them did any work until after they
had eaten breakfast. Even the chores were left until
the male members of the family had broken their
fast, for Godfrey declared that it was not healthy,
in that climate, to breathe too much of the early
morning air, it was so laden with miasma and the seeds
of fever and ague; but he did not seem to think it at
all injurious if inhaled through the fumes of tobacco
smoke, and while seated on the bench beside the cabin
door. That bench served Godfrey in lieu of an easy-chair.
When he was not hunting in the woods or
loafing at the landing, he was always to be found
there, smoking and thinking.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>On the morning of this particular day, Godfrey
arose from his &#8220;shake down&#8221; with the air of a lord,
and astonished two members of his family and alarmed
another, by giving them all a hearty greeting. When
he had dressed himself he filled his pipe, and walking
out of the door with a slow and dignified step, stood
with his hands on his hips, looking about him as if he
were monarch of all he surveyed. Mrs. Evans said
to herself that that was the way he used to act in the
good old days; while Dan communed thus with
himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;If me an&#8217; pop had been out a diggin&#8217; fur that
thar bar&#8217;l last night, an&#8217; had done found it, I should
know that that was what ails him this mornin&#8217;; but
seein&#8217; we didn&#8217;t dig fur the bar&#8217;l, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s
the matter of him. He don&#8217;t walk with that big
leg, an&#8217; sling on all them extry frills, fur nothin&#8217;,
an&#8217; I&#8217;m afeared he&#8217;s smelled out somethin&#8217;. If he
has&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan did not say what he should do, but he shook
his head in the most threatening manner, and having
drawn on his clothes, clapped his hat on his head,
and hurried out of the door. His father looked at
him as he disappeared around the corner of the cabin,
but made no sign beyond looking in at the door to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
satisfy himself that the rawhide was hanging in its
accustomed place.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Dan returned and confronted his
sire. His face wore a fierce frown, and he looked
mad enough for almost anything. He began operations
by jumping up and knocking his heels together,
coming down with a jar and with his feet spread out
as if he were bracing himself for a shock of some
kind. This is an indispensable prelude to all games
of fisticuffs in the South and West. No backwoods
pugilist ever thinks of going into a fight without
thus preparing himself for it. Sometimes a few
Indian yells, given with all the power of the lungs,
help matters wonderfully. Dan went through the performance
just to show his father how angry he
was, and to give him some idea of the damage he
would do if he only possessed the power. Godfrey
looked pleasantly at him, and seated himself on the
bench.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me them six dollars an&#8217; six bits, dog-gone
my buttons,&#8221; sputtered Dan, who could hardly speak
plainly enough to be understood. Then he seemed
to regain control of his tongue, and without giving
his father a chance to reply, went on: &#8220;I knowed
yesterday that ye was up to something,&#8221; said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
&#8220;an&#8217; I knowed this mornin&#8217; when I first seed ye a
struttin&#8217; about, that ye&#8217;d been an&#8217; done some mean
trick. You&#8217;ve been a pokin&#8217; into my things. You&#8217;ve
got my money an&#8217; my powder an&#8217; lead, an&#8217; I want
&#8217;em. The money&#8217;s mine, an&#8217; I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your&#8217;n, is it?&#8221; exclaimed Godfrey. &#8220;Whar
did ye get it, an&#8217; how come ye by it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell ye I got three an&#8217; a half fur that
hind quarter of beef?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but whar did ye get the rest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t ye tell me it didn&#8217;t make no odds to ye
whar I got it so long as I did get it?&#8221; asked Dan.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was yesterday,&#8221; answered Godfrey. &#8220;It
didn&#8217;t make no odds to me yesterday, but it&#8217;s to-morrer
now, an&#8217; it makes a heap of odds. It&#8217;s my bounden
duty to find out whar ye got it an&#8217; how ye came by
it, kase mebbe it wasn&#8217;t honest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoop!&#8221; yelled Dan, jumping up and knocking
his heels together in the excess of his rage. &#8220;Honest!
It&#8217;s a heap honester nor it is to go arter dark into a
man&#8217;s tater-patch an&#8217; dig up the bar&#8217;l o&#8217; money he&#8217;s
got kivered up thar. Now, ole man, I&#8217;ll tell ye
what&#8217;s the gospel truth about that thar bar&#8217;l,&#8221; added
Dan, a bright idea striking him. &#8220;If ye&#8217;ll give
my money back to me, I won&#8217;t say nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
about it; but if ye don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll go straight to the
gen&#8217;ral&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoop!&#8221; shouted Godfrey, in his turn.</p>

<p>As the word left his lips he jumped up from the
bench and made a furious rush toward his son, but
did not succeed in laying hands upon him. The
place where Dan was standing became suddenly
vacant, and a moment afterward a very scared face
looked at Godfrey between the rails of the fence that
surrounded the cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will,&#8221; repeated Dan, who felt comparatively
safe now. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go straight to the gen&#8217;ral an&#8217;
tell him what ye&#8217;re up to, an&#8217; then what&#8217;ll become
of yer bar&#8217;l with the eighty thousand into it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; what&#8217;ll become of yer shiny hats an&#8217; boots,
an&#8217; yer circus hosses, an&#8217; yer guns that break in two
in the middle?&#8221; retorted Godfrey, as soon as his
rage would allow him to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; replied Dan, &#8220;I want my six
dollars and six bits fust; an&#8217; if I don&#8217;t get &#8217;em, I&#8217;ll
knock all yer &#8217;rangements higher nor the moon. I
will, I don&#8217;t care if I don&#8217;t sleep in the house fur a
month arter it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll never sleep in my house again if ye do
that,&#8221; said Godfrey. &#8220;But, Dannie, thar ain&#8217;t no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
use in me an&#8217; you fightin&#8217; over these few greenbacks,
when thar&#8217;s eighty thousand dollars in gold and silver
to be had fur the diggin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to fight nuther, but I want my
money,&#8221; said Dan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Dannie, be a good boy an&#8217; let yer poor
ole pop take keer on it fur ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kase I&#8217;m the oldest an&#8217; know the most, ye know,
an&#8217; it&#8217;s the properest thing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Dan only shook his head decidedly, and
retreated as his father approached the fence. Godfrey
continued to argue the matter, but he could make
no impression upon Dan, whose only reply was,
&#8220;Give me my money;&#8221; and his father was finally
forced to the conclusion that he must either do it, or
have all his hopes of possessing that bar&#8217;l of gold
blasted. He was well enough acquainted with Dan
to know that he never made idle threats, and he saw
that he must compromise in some way, and that too,
if possible, without any loss to his dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Dannie,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I hope ye see that yer
pop is a heap smarter nor ye be, don&#8217;t yer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me them six dollars an&#8217; six bits,&#8221; replied
Dan.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>&#8220;No, ye can&#8217;t have &#8217;em&mdash;bar&#8217;l or no bar&#8217;l, that&#8217;s
flat&mdash;till ye tell me whar ye got &#8217;em. I&#8217;m yer pop,
an&#8217; it&#8217;s my bounden duty to know how ye come by
&#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan hesitated. If he complied with his father&#8217;s
demand, he might whistle for the other five dollars
which Don Gordon still owed David&mdash;or, rather,
which he <i>would</i> owe him as soon as the pointer was
field-broken. If he refused to comply, he would lose
six dollars and seventy-five cents, and that was a
small fortune to him. No matter what he decided
to do, he had a fine prospect of losing money, unless&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, pop,&#8221; he replied suddenly, trying hard to
conceal the excitement occasioned by a lucky thought
that just then occurred to him, &#8220;I know yer a heap
smarter nor I be, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll be a good son to ye, an&#8217;
never try to fool ye no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good boy, Dannie,&#8221; said his father,
thrusting his hand through the fence in the hope
that Dan would lay his own within it. &#8220;Put it thar,
my lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan came a step nearer to the fence, but his actions
indicated that he had no desire to shake hands with
his father. On the contrary, he kept safely out of
his reach.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll never fool ye no more,&#8221; said he, &#8220;honor
bright. An&#8217; will ye promise, honor bright, to give
me the money, all of it, when I tell ye whar I got
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In course I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say honor bright.&#8221;</p>

<p>His father said it, placing his hand in his pocket
at the same time to show that he was ready to keep
his word, and Dan continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Silas Jones give it to me. I made five dollars
outen him choppin&#8217; wood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way to get rich, my boy,&#8221; said Godfrey.
&#8220;Allers do sich little chores when ye can get
&#8217;em to do, an&#8217; hold fast to the money, an&#8217; some day
ye&#8217;ll be wuth yer thousands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now hand it out here,&#8221; said Dan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll hand it out, but not now. I must fust
ax Silas about it. I&#8217;ll have business down to the
landin&#8217; some time to-day, I reckon, an&#8217; arter I ax
Silas, I&#8217;ll give ye the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He owes me ten dollars more,&#8221; cried Dan, greatly
alarmed, and hoping that his father would catch at
the bait thus thrown out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear it,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;Yer rich
already, Dannie, and won&#8217;t need none of the bar&#8217;l<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
when we find it. But if he give ye five dollars an&#8217;
owes ye ten more, ye must a made&mdash;&#8221; here Godfrey
stopped and counted his fingers&mdash;&#8220;ye must a made
fifteen outen him choppin&#8217; wood. Didn&#8217;t ye promise
ye wouldn&#8217;t never try to fool me no more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, come nigher to the fence,&#8221; said Dan,
growing desperate and sinking his voice almost to a
whisper, so that those in the cabin might not hear
his words, &#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;ll tell ye this time, honor bright.
Ye know the ten dollars Dave was goin&#8217; to get fur
breakin&#8217; that pinter pup, don&#8217;t ye? Wal, I jest
slipped up thar an&#8217; axed Mr. Bert would he lend
Dave five of it now to get mam a new dress with, an&#8217;
he said yes, he would. That&#8217;s whar the money came
from, pop, sure&#8217;s you live.&#8221;</p>

<p>Godfrey was satisfied of it; and while he secretly
admired the boy&#8217;s shrewdness, he reproached himself
for not being smart enough to take advantage of the
opening, and thus securing the ten dollars for his
own use. Without a word more he pulled out Dan&#8217;s
money and gave it to him, then walked back to the
bench, picked up his pipe, and went off into a brown
study. He never came out of it until he was called
to breakfast, and even then he hardly aroused himself
sufficiently to know what was going on around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
him. Having satisfied his appetite, he took down
his rifle and left the cabin. As soon as he was out
of sight, Dan arose, put on his hunting equipments
and also disappeared, leaving David and his mother
to themselves.</p>

<p>Godfrey made his way toward General Gordon&#8217;s
house, and on the way stopped at the barn, where the
hostler was at work hitching the grays to the family
carriage. By a little skilful questioning he learned
that the general and his boys were going down to
the landing to meet some visitors, who were coming
from Cincinnati on the Emma Deane; and this piece
of information caused a slight change in the programme
he had laid out before leaving home. He
had come over there on purpose to see Don Gordon,
and secure the balance of the money he had promised
David for breaking the pointer. But he wanted to
see him privately, and believing that his object could
be better attained by waiting a while, he decided to
postpone the interview until the Gordons reached the
landing. The sooner he obtained possession of the
money the better, Godfrey told himself, as he looked
out of one of the stable windows. There was Dan
coming up the road, and his father knew instinctively
what it was that brought him in that direction so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
early in the morning. Dan, however, did not go
near the barn, for he had seen his father stop there.
He kept on toward the landing, and when he was
out of sight, Godfrey shouldered his rifle and followed
him.</p>

<p>We have already seen how Godfrey operated when
he thought the proper time had arrived. Watching
his opportunity he secured an interview with Don
Gordon before Dan did, and had no trouble at all in
inducing him to hand over five dollars of David&#8217;s
money to him. Godfrey was in ecstacies. He shut
his fingers tight about the bill and hurried away as
if he feared that Don might repent and want the
money back after he had time to think about what
he had done. Before he had made half a dozen steps
he was confronted by his son Dan, whose face wore
an expression that Godfrey did not like to see there.
He knew as well what was passing in the boy&#8217;s mind
as he did five minutes afterward when Dan told him
of a determination he had formed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, hallo, Dannie!&#8221; exclaimed Godfrey, as if
the meeting was most unexpected. &#8220;What brung
ye down here so &#8217;arly? I&#8217;ve got that other five
dollars fur ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, ye have, have ye?&#8221; said Dan.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>&#8220;Yes. Ye see, I thought mebbe ye wouldn&#8217;t like
to ax fur this one, seein&#8217; as how ye axed fur the fust,
so I done tuk the trouble to do it myself. Now,
Dannie, I&#8217;ll borrer half of it from ye, an&#8217; pay ye
back when we find that bar&#8217;l&mdash;to-night mebbe!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan drew a long breath of relief. This was a piece
of generosity he had not looked for, and he hastened
to assure his father that he was entirely satisfied with
the proposition, adding:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do ye know what I&#8217;d a done if ye&#8217;d cheated me
outen them five dollars? Wal, I&#8217;d a went straight
to the gen&#8217;ral an&#8217; told him about that thar bar&#8217;l&mdash;yes,
I would!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was just what Godfrey was afraid of, and the
only thing that led him to divide his ill-gotten gains
with Dan. There was a dangerous light in his eyes,
but controlling himself he answered, very good-naturedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, ye see I didn&#8217;t mean to cheat ye, don&#8217;t ye?
Now go an&#8217; git the bill broke over to Silas Jones&#8217;.
I&#8217;d go myself, but if I do, he&#8217;ll want me to pay what
I owe him, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t ready to do that yet. He can
wait till we find that bar&#8217;l.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan took the bill and went away, revolving in his
mind a dozen wild schemes for securing undisputed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
possession of the whole of it. Godfrey watched him
until he disappeared in the store, and then leaned
on his rifle and went off into another brown study.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ongrateful an&#8217; ondutiful scamp!&#8221; thought
he. &#8220;He&#8217;s got the upper hand agin me, that boy
has, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve got to give him half them five dollars,
or have my plans busted. I wish now I hadn&#8217;t told
him about that bar&#8217;l. I&#8217;d go an&#8217; dig fur it myself
o&#8217;nights, only its kinder lonesome bein&#8217; all by myself
in the dark. Folks do say that all sort of critters
an&#8217; strange things is abroad arter night, an&#8217; as I&#8217;ve
seed &#8217;em an&#8217; felt &#8217;em myself, I&#8217;m jest a trifle&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Godfrey finished the sentence by shrugging his
shoulders. He would not have acknowledged, even
to himself, that he was afraid, but that was the plain
English of it. He would hardly go to the wood-pile
alone after dark. It was true that he had seen some
strange things which he could not account for, and
which frightened him almost out of his wits. He
had seen figures flitting along the road in front
of him when he returned home from the landing after
dark, and on two or three occasions, something with
great eyes of fire had glared at him from a fence corner
behind the general&#8217;s barn, and compelled him to
leave the road and go around through the fields to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
reach his house. On other occasions he had been
suddenly and mysteriously tripped up when there
was not a human being within sight of him, and his
hat had been dashed from his head by invisible
hands.</p>

<p>All these things, however, could have been satisfactorily
explained, if Godfrey had only possessed the
courage to inquire into them. If he had caught one
of the figures which ran along the road before him
and disappeared in so bewildering a fashion, he would
have found that it was not a spirit, but a human
being&mdash;a night prowler who had designs upon the
general&#8217;s smoke-house. If he had walked up to the
eyes of fire that glared so savagely at him, he would
have discovered that they were simply holes in a
pumpkin, which had been scooped out to admit a
lighted candle, and he would have seen Don Gordon
lying on the ground at a little distance convulsed
with laughter. The invisible hands which knocked
off his hat and pulled his feet out from under him so
unexpectedly, would, upon investigation, have proved
to be strong cords stretched from one side of the lane
to the other, managed by the same spirit of mischief
who had placed the lighted candle in the hollow
pumpkin, and who had put them there for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
of entertaining himself at the expense of a crowd
of darkies, who were expected to pass along the lane
on their way home from protracted meeting.</p>

<p>All these things happened during the previous
autumn, but Godfrey had not forgotten them. Don
had then just returned from school; and the life he
led on his father&#8217;s plantation was so monotonous,
that he sometimes thought he could not exist much
longer unless something happened to cheer him up a
little. As nothing happened of its own accord, Don
went to work to create opportunities to let off some
of his surplus energy in a good hearty laugh; and
to further this end, he made use of some of the numerous
schoolboy devices he learned while at the
academy. You will know how well he succeeded
when we tell you that in less than a week after he began
operations, the story got abroad that the general&#8217;s
lane was haunted, and there was not a negro in the
neighborhood who could be hired to pass through
there after dark. Godfrey Evans himself would not
do it. He always took to the fields.</p>

<p>We do not say that Don passed his leisure hours
in the most profitable manner, for we know he did
not. We are only telling the story of his life, and
telling it as it happened not so very long ago. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Don himself knew that he might be better employed,
was proved by the fact that he did all this alone, not
even taking Bert into his confidence. He little
thought then that his love of mischief would one day
be the means of getting him into a scrape the like
of which he had never dreamed of, but such was the
fact; and we must hasten on to tell how it was brought
about.</p>

<small>OLD JORDAN&#8217;S &#8220;HAUNT.&#8221;</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">DAN came back to his father with the money simply
because he could think of no way of avoiding
it that did not involve more personal risk than
he cared to encounter. He took pains, however, to
keep out his share, and gave Godfrey only two dollars
and a half, accompanying it with the assurance
that in his (Dan&#8217;s) estimation, his father had been
guilty of a very mean trick, and one that he ought
to be heartily ashamed of.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t ye tell me ye was satisfied?&#8221; asked Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it, but I told ye so kase I was afeared
if I said I wasn&#8217;t, I wouldn&#8217;t get none of the money.
O, I know ye, pop, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t see why ye can&#8217;t go
to work an&#8217; make some money of yer own, &#8217;stead of
ropin&#8217; in on me an&#8217; spilin&#8217; my plans. If ye&#8217;d a kept
outen the way, I&#8217;d a had ten dollars as easy as fallin&#8217;
off a log.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>Godfrey was too much interested in his own
thoughts to carry the discussion any farther. He
breathed easier when he felt the money in his fingers,
and because he had no pocket that would hold it, he
kept it in his hand, and stood around with the rest
of the hangers-on, and saw the Emma Deane come
up to the landing and deposit the passengers and
cargo she had brought. Like the rest he wondered
who the fashionably-dressed young gentlemen were
who got into the general&#8217;s carriage and rode off with
him; and he would have wondered still more had he
been able to look far enough into the future to see
that he, the ragged, worthless Godfrey Evans, would
one day be the trusted companion of one of those
spruce young fellows, and that he would be intimately
connected with him in a certain piece of business
which, when it became known, would set all the
tongues in the country for miles around in motion.</p>

<p>The general and his nephews drove off; the Emma
Deane, as soon as her freight and passengers were
landed, backed out into the stream and once more
turned her head toward New Orleans; the people
who had been brought to the landing by the sound
of her whistle spent a few minutes in exchanging
notes, and then began to disperse; and finally the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
street was entirely deserted except by a few of the
most persistent loafers, who sat on the boxes in front
of Silas Jones&#8217;s store, and whittled and chewed tobacco
for want of a better way of passing the time.
Among these was Godfrey, who sunned himself for
an hour or two like a turtle on his log, and then, with
a deep sigh of regret, shouldered his rifle and bent
his steps toward the woods in which his hopeful son
Dan had long ago disappeared.</p>

<p>When the afternoon began to draw to a close,
nearly the same scenes which we have already described
were enacted at Godfrey&#8217;s humble abode. The
scattered family began to come in, one after the other,
and they found Godfrey sitting on the bench smoking
his pipe. Dan had a bunch of squirrels and a
fine wild turkey thrown over his shoulder; David
brought another dozen of quails which Don Gordon&#8217;s
pointer had stood for him; and Mrs. Evans carried
in her pocket a dollar which she had earned with
her needle that day. Fortunately Godfrey did not
know of that. If he had he would at once have set
his wits at work to conjure up some plan to obtain
possession of it. David was again called upon to
chop the wood, for Dan had disappeared immediately
after skinning the squirrels he brought (he had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
off to hunt up another hiding-place for his valuables),
and Godfrey was so wearied with his hard day&#8217;s
work that he could not have lifted an axe if he had
tried. So David cut the wood and kindled the fire,
and his mother cooked the supper, and Godfrey ate
two men&#8217;s share of it, and then once more seated
himself on the bench and dozed until dark. He
slept two hours or more, and was aroused by Dan,
who wanted to know if he was going to make an
effort to find the barrel that night. Godfrey replied
that he was, and started up with much alacrity; but
his enthusiasm seemed to die away utterly when he
rubbed his eyes and looked about him. He could
see literally nothing. It was as dark as it ever gets
to be. The cabin and the clearing seemed to be surrounded
by solid walls of ebony. There was not a
ray of light to be seen in any direction, nor even a
star.</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendid night,&#8221; said Dan. &#8220;Nothing can&#8217;t
see us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered his father, &#8220;an&#8217; we can&#8217;t see
nothing, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I reckon ye know whar that tater-patch
was, don&#8217;t ye? Ye said ye did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do; but thar was ten acres into it, Dannie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
an&#8217; that&#8217;s a power of ground to dig over with one
shovel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But jest think of the eighty thousand,&#8221; said
Dan.</p>

<p>That was just what Godfrey did think of, and it
was the only thing that could have induced him to
brave the darkness and the terrors of the general&#8217;s
lane, and undertake so herculean a task as digging
up ten acres of ground with one shovel. Was there
not some way in which he could secure the contents
of the barrel, or at least a portion of them, without
the expenditure of any great amount of energy and
strength?</p>

<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; said he, laying his hand on the boy&#8217;s
shoulder and speaking in a low, confidential tone,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinkin&#8217; about something to-day, an&#8217;
when ye know what it is, I want ye to tell me if I
ain&#8217;t the best pop in the world to ye. I&#8217;m gettin&#8217;
old, Dannie, an&#8217; my joints is stiff, an&#8217; the rheumatiz
bothers me fearful, an&#8217; &#8217;tain&#8217;t healthy to be out arter
dark, kase of the fever &#8217;n ager&mdash;leastwise fur an ole
man like me; but fur an&#8217; amazin&#8217; strong, strappin&#8217;
feller like yerself, it don&#8217;t make no matter. Now,
Dannie, if ye&#8217;ll go an&#8217; dig up that thar bar&#8217;l by yerself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
I&#8217;ll give ye half of it, plump down, jest as soon
as we open it&mdash;the very minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I won&#8217;t do it,&#8221; said Dan, promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What fur?&#8221; asked his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kase why, fur two reasons: If I dig up that
thar bar&#8217;l all by myself, I&#8217;ll jest hold fast to the hul
of it, an&#8217; go snacks with nobody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t ye oughter give me something fur tellin&#8217;
ye about it?&#8221; inquired his father.</p>

<p>As Dan could not answer this question in any
other way than by a reply in the affirmative, he did
not answer it all, but went on to state his second
reason.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; in the next place,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
whar the tater-patch was&mdash;thar&#8217;s something else
planted there now, I reckon&mdash;an&#8217; if I did, ye wouldn&#8217;t
ketch me out thar alone on sich a night as this, I&#8217;ll
bet ye. Thar&#8217;s something white walks around out
thar!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t&mdash;don&#8217;t, Dannie!&#8221; exclaimed Godfrey,
casting frightened glances on all sides of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, ye know it as well as me, don&#8217;t ye? I&#8217;ll
go with ye an&#8217; do my share of the diggin&#8217;, but I
won&#8217;t go alone&mdash;that&#8217;s flat!&#8221;</p>

<p>Godfrey groaned, and for a moment was on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
point of backing squarely out, and saying that he
didn&#8217;t believe that the barrel was there; and if it
was it might stay there for all he would do toward
digging it up. But he did not back out. He had
the best of reasons for believing that the barrel <i>was</i>
there, and that it was full of gold and silver. A
little extra exertion might put him in possession of
it. Perhaps with the very first blow of the shovel
he might strike the treasure, and then his troubles
would all be over. The visions of ease and happiness
which this thought conjured up, gave zeal to his
flagging spirits and courage to his heart; and picking
up his hat, which had fallen from his head while he
was dozing on the bench, he told Dan to lead on,
and they would find that barrel if all the white things
in the country should come there to scare them away.</p>

<p>Together they moved off in the darkness, and
made their way to the lane behind the general&#8217;s barn,
where Dan had hidden the spade in the fence corner.</p>

<p>It was the work of but a few seconds to find the
implement, and then the father and son climbed the
fence and struck off across the fields toward the potato-patch
where the barrel was buried. When they
reached it they found that the field was still planted
to potatoes, and Dan noticed, with no little uneasiness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
that it was closer to the house than he would like to
have had it. The noise of the spade striking against
the barrel&mdash;when they found it&mdash;or a word uttered
in too loud a tone of voice, would arouse Don Gordon&#8217;s
hounds, and they would alarm the family, the
members of which they could see passing back and
forth before the windows through which the lights
shone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, pop,&#8221; said Dan, suddenly; &#8220;won&#8217;t they
see the holes in the mornin&#8217;? An&#8217; if they keep
on findin&#8217; &#8217;em, won&#8217;t they think thar&#8217;s somethin&#8217; up,
an&#8217; watch to see who it is that&#8217;s a diggin&#8217; &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they won&#8217;t, kase they won&#8217;t see &#8217;em,&#8221; replied
his father. &#8220;We&#8217;ll dig down till we find thar ain&#8217;t
no bar&#8217;l thar, an&#8217; then we&#8217;ll shove the dirt back again,
an&#8217; dig in some other place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How deep&#8217;ll we have to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, not much more&#8217;n the deepness of a bar&#8217;l, kase
why, ye see Jordan wouldn&#8217;t have no time to dig a
deep hole to kiver up the bar&#8217;l in, when he knowed
that the Yanks was a comin&#8217;. He done a good thing
fur us, Jordan did, in runnin&#8217; away without tellin&#8217;
his missus whar that bar&#8217;l was hid. Now, Dannie,
let&#8217;s try right here fust. Ye begin, kase yer the
youngest, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll set down an&#8217; smoke an&#8217; watch ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
till yer tired. Now bar in mind that yer workin&#8217; fur
eighty thousand dollars! Throw it out with the
fust shovelful an&#8217; I&#8217;ll give ye half!&#8221;</p>

<p>One to have watched Dan&#8217;s movements would have
thought that he meant to accomplish something. He
peeled off his coat and threw it on the ground, dashed
his hat down beside it, tucked up his sleeves, moistened
his hands and brought them together with a
loud slap, seized the shovel and thrust it twice into the
ground, bringing out each time scarcely more than a
good-sized handful of earth, and then stopped and
looked all around the field as far as his eyes could
reach in the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten acres <i>is</i> a heap o&#8217; ground, pop,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind that, Dannie,&#8221; replied his father,
scratching a match on his shirt sleeve and applying
it to the bowl of his pipe. &#8220;Thar&#8217;s a bar&#8217;l with
eighty thousand dollars in gold an&#8217; silver into it
buried somewhar about here, an&#8217; we must have it if
we have to dig up the whole state of Missip. Laws
a massy! what&#8217;s the matter of ye?&#8221; he exclaimed;
for Dan had stooped down and seized his arm with
a gripe that almost brought from him a cry of pain.</p>

<p>Dan stooped still lower, pointed with his finger
and said in a husky whisper,</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>&#8220;Pop, jest look a thar!&#8221;</p>

<p>The tone in which these words were uttered sent
the cold chills all over Godfrey. His breath came
in short, quick gasps, his knees knocked together,
and he slowly and painfully arose from the ground,
turning his head as he did so, and looking in the
direction Dan pointed. There, almost within reach
of them, so close apparently that he could have touched
it with the shovel, if he had been so disposed, was a
little ball of fire which glowed and sparkled as he
looked at it, then faded almost entirely away for an
instant, and anon glowed and sparkled with greater
brilliancy than before. Godfrey&#8217;s under jaw dropped
down, his pipe fell to the ground and for a moment he
gazed as if fascinated; then he reached for the shovel,
and with long, noiseless steps glided across the field
toward the lane, closely followed by Dan, who hardly
dared to wait long enough to pick up his coat and
hat, so frightened was he. Neither of them spoke
until they were fairly in the &#8220;big road&#8221; which led
to the cabin, and then Dan said, in a suppressed
whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it, pop?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of them haunts with eyes of fire like I
used to see last fall,&#8221; replied his father, looking back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
to make sure that the object, whatever it was, was
not following him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this only had one eye, pop!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No odds. They all b&#8217;long to the same breed,
whether they&#8217;ve got one eye or a dozen. Ole nigger
Hudson told me he seed one onct that was all eyes
all over his head. Dannie, that was the fust time I
ever was clost enough to one of them critters to see
him wink!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, pop,&#8221; exclaimed Dan, suddenly, &#8220;I reckon
we&#8217;d best give up lookin&#8217; fur that thar bar&#8217;l, kase
mebbe that&#8217;s ole Jordan&#8217;s haunt come back to keep
folks away from it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Godfrey stopped and looked at his son.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet ye&#8217;ve hit centre, Dannie,&#8221; said he, after
thinking a moment. &#8220;But if that&#8217;s so, we was clost
to whar the bar&#8217;l is, or else the haunt wouldn&#8217;t a been
thar. It&#8217;ll save us a heap o&#8217; diggin&#8217;, Dannie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet ye don&#8217;t get me nigh that tater patch no
more,&#8221; said Dan, decidedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll go myself, an&#8217; ye shan&#8217;t have
none of the money. Then what&#8217;ll become of yer
shiny boots an&#8217; yer circus hosses, and yer fine guns
that break in two in the middle?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan made no answer. He did not like to lose all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
these nice things on which he had set his heart, but
there was old Jordan&#8217;s &#8220;haunt&#8221; (that is a term which
some people in the South apply to what we call a
ghost), of which he stood in great fear. He could
not then make up his mind just what he would do in
the future, so he said nothing more, and neither did
his father. They finished their walk in silence, and
reaching the cabin, went to bed and tried to go to
sleep. But that was for a long time quite impossible.
The remembrance of their evening&#8217;s experience
kept them awake, and it was not until the gray
streaks of dawn began to stream in through the
cracks in the cabin walls, that they fell into an uneasy
slumber. They arose at the usual hour, however,
and David chopped wood while his mother
cooked breakfast, and Dan loafed and Godfrey sat
on the bench and smoked and meditated.</p>

<p>The meal over, Dan shouldered his rifle and disappeared,
and Godfrey, because he could not make
up his mind to do anything else, resumed his pipe
and his meditations, from which he was aroused by
the sight of a stranger coming along the road from
the direction of General Gordon&#8217;s. Godfrey looked
closely at him, and saw that he was one of the two
young men whom he had seen land from the steamer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Emma Deane on the previous day. He carried a
gun of some description in his hands, a game-bag
hung over his shoulder, and he was dressed in a hunting
suit of the latest and most fashionable cut. He
walked leisurely along, stopping now and then and
looking about as if he were searching for some object
to try his skill upon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; sneered Godfrey, who at once took a
dislike to the hunter on account of his good clothes.
&#8220;Yer a nice lookin&#8217; chap to be loafin&#8217; about with a
gun in yer hands. I&#8217;ll take my ole Betsey Jane
an&#8217; beat the hind sights off&#8217;n a hul army of yer.
That&#8217;s jest what makes me so savage agin everybody.
What this feller&#8217;s clothes cost would keep me an&#8217;
my family in grub all the winter!&#8221;</p>

<p>While Godfrey was talking thus to himself, the
stranger stopped again, raised his gun quickly to
his shoulder and fired, the weapon making a report
scarcely louder than that of an ordinary gun cap.
Godfrey sneered again, and was about to give it as
his private opinion that such a load as that would
not kill anything, when he was surprised to see a
squirrel leave the very topmost branch of a tall
hickory that stood by the roadside, and come to the
ground dead. The hunter loaded his weapon before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
he went to pick up his game, and Godfrey saw that
he carried a breech-loader. He became interested
at once, and began to have some respect for the
stranger who had shown himself to be no mean
marksman. He arose and took his pipe out of his
mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do?&#8221; said he, as he went to meet the hunter.
&#8220;I &#8217;lowed that ye wouldn&#8217;t get nothing that shot, no
how. Ye wouldn&#8217;t take no offence if I should ax
ye to let me see that we&#8217;pon o&#8217; your&#8217;n?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; said the stranger politely, removing
the cartridge and handing the rifle to Godfrey.
&#8220;You do not often see guns of this description
down here, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never seed one jest like this afore. I reckon
yer from some city up North, ain&#8217;t ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I am Clarence Gordon, and my brother
and I are down here on a visit to our cousins, Don
and Bert. You are Mr. Evans, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sarvent, sar,&#8221; said Godfrey, who could not
remember that any one had ever put a handle to his
name before. He was flattered by this show of
respect, and Clarence could not have approached him
in any way better calculated to gain his good will.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Evans, I hope we shall see much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
each other,&#8221; said Clarence. &#8220;It is possible that I may
stay here until spring, that is, if there is good hunting
in the neighborhood; is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye couldn&#8217;t come to a better place, if that&#8217;s what
ye want,&#8221; said Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is just what I want. I am very fond of it,
but I know but little about it, having always lived
in the city, and I shall need somebody to teach me.
I know of no one more capable of acting as my instructor
than yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence saw by the vacant, bewildered expression
on the man&#8217;s face that he did not understand his fine
language, so he hastened to add:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am told that you are a fine shot with the rifle
and the best hunter in the country. You never come
from the woods without something to show as a proof
of your skill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, that thar&#8217;s a fact,&#8221; said Godfrey, who now
began to see what Clarence was getting at. &#8220;I know
right whar all the game rises, an&#8217; as fur larnin&#8217; folks&mdash;wal,
thar&#8217;s my two boys. They didn&#8217;t know
nothin&#8217; when I fust took &#8217;em in hand, an&#8217; to-day
thar ain&#8217;t nobody about here can beat &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are just the man I want, and I wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
you would take me in hand. Squirrels are plenty
about here, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye can&#8217;t run amiss of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any deer or turkeys?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, stranger, yer jest a shoutin&#8217;! Is thar any?
I killed twenty-three deer last winter, an&#8217; massy
knows how many turkeys, kase I never kept count
of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you too busy to go out in the woods with
me for a little while?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I <i>have</i> got a sight o&#8217; work to do, that&#8217;s a
fact,&#8221; said Godfrey, who always tried to make it
appear that his time was fully occupied, &#8220;but I reckon
it might wait till I get back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have some cigars in my pocket,&#8221; said Clarence,
glancing at Godfrey&#8217;s dingy cob-pipe, &#8220;and perhaps
you would like to shoot my rifle a few times, just to
see how a breech-loader works.&#8221;</p>

<p>This made Godfrey sure that his work could wait.
He hastened into the cabin, and presently returned
with his gun on his shoulder and his bullet-pouch
under his arm. After he had loaded the weapon,
the two climbed over the fence and disappeared in
the woods.</p>

<small>WHAT GODFREY&#8217;S VISITOR WANTED.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">GODFREY and his visitor had not gone very far
into the woods, before the former told himself
that if Clarence had come out there for the purpose
of hunting squirrels, he certainly knew very little
of the nature of the animals of which he was in search.
He talked incessantly, and in a tone of voice loud
enough to frighten all the wild animals for a quarter
of a mile around. He did not say &#8220;squirrel&#8221; once,
and neither did he appear to be anxious to find any,
for he was more interested in studying the face of
his companion, than in searching the tree tops where
the game was most likely to be found. So closely
did he watch Godfrey that the latter became uneasy;
and when he could no longer endure his scrutiny he
said, suddenly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do ye think ye ever seed me afore, Mr. Clarence,
or what&#8217;s the matter of ye? Yer tongue says one
thing to me, an&#8217; yer face says another.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>&#8220;Well, what does my face say?&#8221; asked Clarence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t quite seem to make out, an&#8217; that&#8217;s why
I axed ye. Ye look as though ye wanted to say
something to me and didn&#8217;t know how to begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Evans, you would soon make yourself rich
if you were to turn fortune-teller,&#8221; said Clarence.
&#8220;You have hit the nail squarely on the head.
Have a weed?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, he thrust his hand into one of the
pockets of his game-bag, and brought it out again
filled with cigars. Either by accident or design he
brought something else, too&mdash;something that fell on
the ground at Godfrey&#8217;s feet, and at which he gazed
as if fascinated. It was the cob-pipe he had lost the
night before in General Gordon&#8217;s potato patch.
After making sure that it was his own property, he
looked toward Clarence, who could scarcely refrain
from laughing outright, so utterly astounded and
bewildered did Godfrey seem to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whar did ye get it?&#8221; he demanded, as soon as
he could speak, &#8220;an&#8217; how came ye by it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I found it in the potato patch where you and
Dan were digging last night. You did not find the
eighty thousand, did you? Why, what&#8217;s the matter
with you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>Clarence was not a little surprised at the effect of
his words. They seemed to take away all Godfrey&#8217;s
strength, and to crush him completely. He wilted
before the boy&#8217;s eyes like a blade of grass that had
been struck by the frost. He looked around for a
place to sit down, but as he could not find any to
suit him, he sat down right where he was and groaned
aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; repeated Clarence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you that was my pipe?&#8221; asked Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;My intuition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My instinct.&#8221;</p>

<p>Godfrey looked more bewildered than ever. &#8220;Ye
mean that the haunt told ye, don&#8217;t ye?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;The haunt!&#8221; repeated Clarence. &#8220;What&#8217;s
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the sperrit; the&mdash;the&mdash;ole Jordan&#8217;s ghost.
He was thar, kase I seed him. Whar was you, Mr.
Clarence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was in the house, where all honest folks were
at that time of the night. Did you say you saw a
ghost?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did say so, an&#8217; I done seed it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did it look like?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see all of him&mdash;only jest the eye; an&#8217;
that was a watchin&#8217; us, kase I could see it wink.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where was it?&#8221; asked Clarence, elevating his
eye-brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down in the fence corner, clost by that big
butternut tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy stared, then laid down his rifle and
seated himself on the nearest log. He seemed to be
very much impressed by what he had heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knowed all the time that you didn&#8217;t come out
here to shoot no squirrels,&#8221; said Godfrey, &#8220;kase
if they was what ye wanted, ye could a found a cartload
of &#8217;em nigher to the gen&#8217;ral&#8217;s house. Now,
what be ye a goin&#8217; to do about it? Be ye goin&#8217; to
tell yer uncle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That depends entirely upon yourself,&#8221; was the
reply, which quickly put all Godfrey&#8217;s fears at rest.
&#8220;I would much rather help you dig up the barrel
and then divide its contents with you&mdash;that is, if
there is any barrel there, and we have a chance of
finding it.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Godfrey had already committed himself he knew
that it was too late to deny anything, so he replied
that to the best of his knowledge and belief the barrel
was hidden somewhere in that potato-patch; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
at the boy&#8217;s request he went on to tell why he thought
so. He told him the story of the buried treasure
just as he had told it before to the members of his
family, and Clarence listened to every word. When
Godfrey ended his tale he questioned him closely;
and when he got up half an hour afterward to stretch
his arms and legs, he believed as firmly as Godfrey
did that there was a fortune concealed in his uncle&#8217;s
potato-patch. He said so too, and proposed to Godfrey
that they should search for it together, and,
when they found it, divide the contents, whatever
they might be.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one thing about it,&#8221; continued Clarence;
&#8220;two are enough to engage in any such enterprise
as this, and I&#8217;ll have nothing whatever to do with it,
unless you promise that Dan shall be left in the
background. We don&#8217;t want him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No fear about him,&#8221; replied Godfrey. &#8220;He seed
the haunt as well as me, an&#8217; says he won&#8217;t go thar no
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad of it, and I hope he will stick to his
resolution,&#8221; said Clarence. &#8220;But, in order to make
sure of it, you had better tell him that you are not
going near the field again yourself. You can slip
away from him every night, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>&#8220;I reckon I can; but if ye was in the house last
night, whar all honest folks was, how did ye find out
about this bar&#8217;l, Mr. Clarence? An&#8217; who brung ye
this pipe an&#8217; told ye it was mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the third or fourth time that Godfrey had
asked this question during their interview, which
had already lasted more than an hour, and Clarence
replied now as he had done before&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you just at present. I may tell you
some day after you and I get to be good friends, and
I find out that I can trust you. When you become
better acquainted with me, you will see that I have
a way of finding out a good many things.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two talked for an hour longer on these matters,
and at the end of that time Godfrey was satisfied
that what he had at first believed to be a dire
misfortune, had turned out to be the luckiest thing
that ever happened to him. He knew that Dan
could never be induced to go near that potato-patch
again in the dark, for he had been frightened out of
a year&#8217;s growth already; but Godfrey needed an
assistant all the same, and here was one worth having.
Godfrey was astonished at the courage the boy
exhibited. Clarence scouted the idea of haunts and
ghosts and all other things of like character, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
although he did not pretend to account for the invisible
hands that had so often tripped Godfrey up and
knocked his hat from his head, he was sure that there
was nothing supernatural about them, and promised
that if any such pranks were played on Godfrey
while he was near, he would find out how they were
done, and who was to blame for them. They came
to a perfect understanding on every point that arose
regarding their future actions; but there were some
things connected with the past that remained a sealed
book to Godfrey. The latter would have given every
thing he possessed to know how Clarence came by
the pipe that he had dropped in the potato-patch,
and how he had found out who the owner was. He
wanted to know how the boy had learned of the existence
of the barrel with the eighty thousand dollars
in it; how he had found out what his (Godfrey&#8217;s)
name was; how it came that he could recognise him
the moment he saw him; and why he offered to
assist him in looking for the barrel. If he had been
like most nephews, he would have gone straight to
his uncle and told him what was going on in his potato-patch
after dark. Godfrey tried his best to surprise
or coax Clarence into giving him some information
on these points, but without the least success;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
and he was finally obliged to make up his mind that
they were mysteries that time only could clear away.</p>

<p>Another thing that surprised and delighted Godfrey
was the condescension and familiarity with which
the boy treated him. Clarence was, at the same
time, much more respectful to him than Dan was,
and Godfrey already began to feel perfectly at ease
in his presence. He saw the force of one command
that Clarence laid upon him, and readily promised to
obey it, namely: that no matter how intimate they
might be while they were by themselves, there was
to be none of that sort of thing should they chance
to meet in company. They must meet as strangers,
and never so much as look at each other. They
did not want to arouse anybody&#8217;s curiosity or suspicions,
and so they could not be too careful.</p>

<p>When the matter had been thoroughly discussed
and they knew just what they were going to do, they
arose and walked slowly towards the cabin. They
stopped on the way to shoot a few squirrels, and
Godfrey, surprised at the accuracy of the little breech-loader,
which seemed as light as a feather beside his
long, heavy muzzle-loader, declared that he would
have one exactly like it, just as soon as he received
his share of the contents of the barrel. They held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
another short consultation when they reached the
clearing, and after each had promised to be at the
general&#8217;s barn as soon after dark as he could get
there, Clarence started homeward, while Godfrey
filled his pipe, and sat down to smoke and think.
He was in such a fever of suspense that he never
thought of getting himself any dinner, and even when
supper time came, he could scarcely arouse himself
from his air-castle building, long enough to eat his
share of the corn-bread and squirrels. When it began
to grow dark he grew more restless than ever, and
his impatience to be at work increased every minute.
He was not afraid of old Jordan&#8217;s haunt so long as
he was in the presence of the general&#8217;s nephew, and
neither was he any longer afraid of the work he
might have to do before the barrel would be brought
to light; for Clarence had discoursed in such glowing
language of the comforts and pleasures that could be
purchased for eighty thousand dollars, that Godfrey
would have thought nothing of digging up twenty
acres with a single spade, if he could obtain that
amount of money by so doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dannie,&#8221; said Godfrey, who saw that the boy
was loitering about as if waiting for something, &#8220;it&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
time fur us to be lookin&#8217; fur that bar&#8217;l agin, I
reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, ye can look then, if ye want to,&#8221; was the
dutiful reply, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t stir one inch. I don&#8217;t
want to see ole Jordan&#8217;s haunt agin, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t
b&#8217;lieve the bar&#8217;l&#8217;s thar, nohow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ve hit centre agin, Dannie, like ye allers do,&#8221;
replied his father. &#8220;I don&#8217;t b&#8217;lieve it&#8217;s thar nuther;
an&#8217; if it is, ten acres is too much ground fur two fellers
to dig up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then whar be yer goin&#8217;?&#8221; asked Dan, as Godfrey
arose to his feet and picked up his hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I ain&#8217;t agoin&#8217; nowhars; but I can&#8217;t sleep
arter losin&#8217; them eighty thousand, so I am goin&#8217; out
to walk about a bit afore goin&#8217; to bed. Ye go in an&#8217;
stay with yer mam, like a good boy, an&#8217; yer poor
ole pop&#8217;ll go out an&#8217; think over his hard luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>These words, and the way they were spoken, were
enough to arouse Dan&#8217;s suspicions at once. His
father never called him a good boy or addressed him
in that wheedling tone, unless he had an object to
gain. And the fact that he was going off alone in
the dark was another thing that looked suspicious.
He had not done such a thing for long months; and
after a little reflection Dan very naturally arrived at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the conclusion that there was something going on
that his father did not want him to know anything
about. He went into the house and stayed a minute
or two, and then came out and hurried down the road
towards General Gordon&#8217;s lane.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Godfrey was making the best of his
way toward the barn, where he expected to meet his
new friend, Clarence. He walked with noiseless footsteps,
casting anxious glances on all sides of him,
and acting altogether like a man who expected to
encounter some terrible danger. Indeed this was
just what he did expect. He opened the creaking
gate that led from the lane into the barn-yard, and
was frightened almost out of his senses when he saw
a dark figure rise suddenly into view and come
toward him. His first impulse was to take to his
heels; but he checked it and drew a long breath of
relief when he heard a well-known voice say, in no
very amiable tones:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you arrived at last? I began to think you
were never coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve come,&#8221; replied Godfrey, &#8220;but I &#8217;most
wish I had stayed to hum. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t honest, sich work
as this yere hain&#8217;t. If thar&#8217;s a bar&#8217;l with eighty
thousand dollars in gold an&#8217; silver into it, hid in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
gen&#8217;ral&#8217;s tater-patch, we&#8217;d oughter tell him, &#8217;stead
of goin&#8217; an&#8217; diggin&#8217; it up ourselves!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hallo! what&#8217;s come over you all of a sudden?&#8221;
demanded Clarence, angrily. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t talk this
way when I last saw you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it; but it was daylight then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and now that it is dark you have turned
coward, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal&mdash;no! but if I should see ole Jordan&#8217;s white
coat down thar in that tater-patch, I do think in my
soul it would be the last of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll not see him or his white coat, either.
You haven&#8217;t heard of him for long years, and who
knows but he is dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sartin he is,&#8221; returned Godfrey, earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you have nothing to fear from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not from him, I know; but his haunt is what
bothers me. I&#8217;ve seed that once, an&#8217; nobody can&#8217;t
make me say I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll promise you that you shall never see it
again,&#8221; said Clarence, impatiently. &#8220;Why, man
alive, just think of it! Some people would be willing
to work and slave for a whole life time to make
forty thousand dollars, and here we have a chance
to dig it up in half an hour&mdash;in less time, too, if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
happen to strike the right spot. Doesn&#8217;t that thought
put any courage or ambition into you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Probably it did, for without another word Godfrey
seized the shovel that Clarence extended toward
him, and hurried away in the direction of the potato-patch.</p>

<p>We need not follow them any farther, for they did
not find the hidden treasure that night. It will be
enough to say that, following the example Clarence
set him, Godfrey did something he had not done
before for a number of years&mdash;he worked until he
raised a copious perspiration; that he kept a bright
look out for the eye of fire that had so badly frightened
him and Dan the night before; that he and his companion
dug a dozen holes in what they supposed to
be the most &#8220;likely&#8221; spots, in each case shovelling
back the earth they had thrown out, so that their
work might not attract the attention of any of the
general&#8217;s field hands in the morning; that after three
hours&#8217; hard labor Godfrey handed his shovel to
Clarence, who promised to put it back where he had
found it; and that the two separated with mutual
promises to meet again at the same place and hour
on the following evening. Neither of them were
disheartened by their failure. On the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Godfrey was encouraged, for he had learned to his
satisfaction that if old Jordan&#8217;s haunt had really
come back there to protect the barrel, he would not
appear so long as Clarence Gordon was on the ground.
He went home and slept soundly after his unusual
exercise, and awoke the next morning feeling that
he was nearer to attaining his hopes than he had
ever been before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, jest a quarter of an acre nearer,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;kase what ground we dug up last night, won&#8217;t never
have to be dug up agin. Mr. Clarence is better to
have along in sich work as that nor an army of them
lazy Dans would be, kase he ain&#8217;t afeared of nothing,
an&#8217; pitches in an&#8217; does his share. It was jest amazin&#8217;
how he did fling the dirt outen them holes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Breakfast being over Godfrey&#8217;s pipe came into use,
and he smoked and meditated during the best part
of the forenoon. His family, as usual, were all away,
and he had the premises to himself. There was no
one to disturb him, and he could build air-castles to
his heart&#8217;s content. In this agreeable occupation he
passed the time until eleven o&#8217;clock, and was then
called back to earth again, by the sound of footsteps
coming rapidly along the road. He looked up, and
saw that the one who had so rudely aroused him was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
his hopeful son Dan, whose whole appearance indicated
that he had something marvellous to communicate.
One look was enough to satisfy Godfrey of
this fact, and his heart fairly came up into his mouth.
He began to imagine all sorts of evil things directly;
and being anxious to know the worst at once, he tried
hard to speak to Dan, but could not utter a sound to
save his life.</p>

<p>Dan lost no time in passing over the fifty yards
that lay between him and the cabin. As he threw
himself on the bench beside his father, his rifle slipped
from his grasp and fell to the ground, and his head
moved from side to side as if he had lost all control
of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, then!&#8221; exclaimed Godfrey, finding his
tongue at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, pop!&#8221; cried Dan, &#8220;it&#8217;s come. We did see
it that night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s come, an&#8217; what night did we see it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, ole Jordan&#8217;s haunt,&#8221; gasped Dan. &#8220;I
seed him jest now in broad daylight&mdash;I did, as sure&#8217;s
I&#8217;m settin&#8217; on this yere bench tellin&#8217; ye&mdash;an&#8217; thar
was others seed him too; an&#8217; thar was that eye of
his&#8217;n in the middle of his head, an&#8217; it kept a flickerin&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
an&#8217; a winkin&#8217; jest as it done that night in the dark.
O, my soul!&#8221;</p>

<p>Godfrey hardly knew what to do with himself, so
terrified and astounded was he. He took his pipe
out of his mouth, jumped up from the bench, and
looked all around as if he were trying to make up
his mind which way to run first.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, it ain&#8217;t a comin&#8217; here,&#8221; said Dan, who could
tell by these movements what his father was thinking
about. &#8220;It done went into the gen&#8217;ral&#8217;s barn. It&#8217;s
got a hidin&#8217;-place in thar.&#8221;</p>

<p>These words reassured Godfrey, who being satisfied
that the terrible apparition was at a safe distance,
seated himself on the bench again, and began to
question Dan. He hoped that the boy was mistaken,
and that his very lively imagination had converted a
stump or some other object he had seen in the woods,
into what he supposed to be old Jordan&#8217;s ghost; but
Dan gave his evidence in such a way, and was so
very positive on every point on which his father asked
information, that Godfrey was obliged to believe that
he had seen something wonderful. Perhaps after
the reader hears Dan&#8217;s story he will believe it too.
We will follow him, but tell it in our way.</p>

<p>Dan said he had had better luck in the woods that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
morning than he usually did&mdash;the bunch of squirrels
he exhibited, and to which he had held fast during
his headlong flight, proved that statement&mdash;and having
shot all the game he wanted, he was coming home
by way of the general&#8217;s lane. He saw the hostler
and two or three other negroes standing in front of
the barn, and when he came up he found that they
were holding an earnest consultation, and that they
were all more or less frightened. Dan at once inquired
into the cause of their alarm, and was informed
that something very strange and mysterious had just
happened. The hostler was busy with his usual
duties in the barn, and the others were at work in
the field close by, when a queer-looking object suddenly
made its appearance among them. It was
dressed in a suit of white cottonade, and looked and
acted like an old, decrepit negro; but it could not
have been that, for if it had been, it would have
returned some of the numerous greetings that were
addressed to it. Besides, it did not seem to hear or
see anything.</p>

<p>It was first discovered by the hostler, and where
it came from he couldn&#8217;t tell. It walked past him,
and out at the door toward the place where the men
were at work in the field. These&mdash;there were three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
of them&mdash;thought they recognised in it an old friend
from whom they had long been separated, and throwing
down their hoes they hurried toward the figure,
extending their hands and crying out: &#8220;How do,
Uncle Jordan!&#8221; But the figure paid no attention
to them, and it finally dawned upon the negroes that
it was not Jordan after all, but his spirit, which had
come back to visit the scenes with which the faithful
slave had been familiar while in the flesh. After
that the figure had all the room it wanted. The
negroes backed off and watched it as it walked slowly
about the barn-yard, and finally disappeared behind
one of the corn-cribs. They waited for it to appear
again, but as it did not, one of the boldest ventured
to draw near and peep around the corner of the crib.
There was no one in sight.</p>

<p>This made it evident that the object they had seen
was a spirit, and nothing else; for if it had been a
human being, it could not have got out from behind
the corn-crib without being seen by some of the
watchful negroes. The crib joined the barn, and
there was no entrance to either of the buildings on
that side that could be made available, except the
door, and that could be seen through the front doors,
which stood wide open. There was a window which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
opened into a storeroom in the barn, but it was
securely nailed, and had not been opened for a number
of years.</p>

<p>The negroes told this extraordinary story in low
tones, and rolled the whites of their eyes and trembled
and gave other indications that their minds were
in a very unsettled state, and that a very small thing
would get up a first-class panic among them. As
Dan listened the cold chills crept all over him, and
his hair seemed to stand on end. What then must
have been his terror when one of the negroes suddenly
clapped his hands and shrieked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord a mussy, look down on us poor, miserable
niggers! Dar he is now!&#8221;</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>OLD JORDAN SHOWS HIMSELF.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THIS startling announcement was accompanied
by such strange contortions on the part of the
negro who made it, that Dan was completely unnerved,
and would have taken to his heels in short
order, had he not suddenly lost all control over himself.
His whole body seemed weighed down with
iron. He did, however, manage to turn his head
and look in the direction in which his sable companions
were gazing, and sure enough, there he was&mdash;an
old, rheumatic negro, bent half double with age,
and dressed in that peculiar costume so common
among field negroes before the war. He leaned
heavily upon a staff&mdash;which, however, he planted
firmly, almost viciously on the ground with every
step, as if there was plenty of strength left in his old
arm&mdash;and walked in that indescribable manner which
no one ever saw attempted by anybody except a
plantation negro.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>When first seen he was in the middle of the lane;
and how he ever got there without being observed,
was a mystery. He was coming toward the barn,
and when he arrived opposite to it he turned toward
the open doors, and Dan and the terrified negroes
backed hastily out of his way. He looked neither to
the right nor left, but entered the barn, went the
whole length of it, and disappeared through the door
at the other end.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s ole Jordan, if I ever seed him,&#8221; exclaimed
one of the negroes, all of whom turned as white as
their black skins would let them.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sar; &#8217;tain&#8217;t ole Jordan, nudder&mdash;dat ain&#8217;t,&#8221;
said another; &#8220;kase ole Jordan, if it was him,
wouldn&#8217;t go right fru us dat way, widout speakin&#8217; to
nobody. Whar&#8217;s he gwine now?&#8221;</p>

<p>The negro, as he asked this question, started on
tiptoe toward the back door, followed by his companions
and Dan. Arriving on the spot where the
figure had last been seen, they looked in every direction,
but could see nothing of it. Gathering a little
more courage, they went to the end of the corn-crib
and looked around it. There was no one in sight.
After that they went around the barn, keeping close
together for mutual protection, but old Jordan had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
disappeared as completely as though he had never
been in existence. Then the negroes began to grow
frightened again. The hostler declared that he
would never go into that barn again; those who had
been at work in the field retreated in great haste
toward the house; and Dan, who dared not stay
there alone, shouldered his rifle, got over the tall
gate somehow, and stepped out for home at his very
best pace.</p>

<p>This was the substance of the story Dan told his
father, and Godfrey listened to it with open mouth
and staring eyes. He knew that ghosts appeared at
night&mdash;nobody could talk or laugh him out of that
belief, for he knew it to be true by his own experience&mdash;but
he had never before heard that they grew
so bold as to show themselves in broad daylight.
&#8220;This yere beats my time all holler,&#8221; said he, as
he found his tongue. &#8220;I declar&#8217;, folks ain&#8217;t safe
nowhar, an&#8217; at no time, day nor night. Dannie,
that thar bar&#8217;l is in that tater-patch as sure&#8217;s you&#8217;re
an inch high; kase if it ain&#8217;t, what makes ole Jordan&#8217;s
haunt come back here foolin&#8217; around? He
didn&#8217;t act as though he wanted to hurt anybody, did
he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but he had a big club in his hand,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Dan, whose frightened optics had magnified an ordinary
walking-stick, just as they had cheated their
owner into believing that the apparition, or whatever
it was, had an eye of fire in the middle of his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of a club was it?&#8221; asked his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, a great big one! an&#8217; it was all curled and
twisted up like a snake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seed ole Jordan walkin&#8217; with it a million
times,&#8221; said Godfrey. &#8220;He used it this yere way,
didn&#8217;t he?&#8221; he added, picking up a stick, that happened
to be lying near him, and imitating the energetic
manner in which the old negro handled his
cane.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s jest the way he done,&#8221; said Dan.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; he walked this way, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221; continued
Godfrey, bending his back and legs, drawing his
head down between his shoulders and mimicking old
Jordan&#8217;s style of progression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; that&#8217;s jest the way he walked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s his haunt, an&#8217; thar ain&#8217;t no mistake
about it,&#8221; said Godfrey, throwing down the stick and
pushing back his sleeves. &#8220;Jest fetch out my rifle,
Dannie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, pop, what be ye goin&#8217; to do?&#8221; gasped Dan.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin up thar,&#8221; was the reply; and any one
who had seen Godfrey when he made it, never would
have imagined that only a few short hours before he had
been so badly frightened, that he could not run half
fast enough to suit him. He looked brave enough to
meet a lion single-handed. &#8220;I want to see that
thing,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;an&#8217; I want to see it in the
daytime, too&mdash;not arter dark, as I did afore!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, now, I ain&#8217;t agoin&#8217; to stay here alone, I bet
ye,&#8221; whined Dan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then come along with yer pop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye needn&#8217;t be afeared; kase I&#8217;ve heard tell that
them haunts can&#8217;t harm nobody in the daytime.
Ye see, if it&#8217;s ole Jordan&#8217;s haunt, his comin&#8217; back
here proves that we&#8217;ve dug a hole purty clost to that
thar bar&#8217;l; an&#8217; if Mr.&mdash;&mdash; Hum! Bring out my
we&#8217;pon, Dannie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Godfrey was about to add that if Mr. Clarence,
after hearing of what had just taken place, was not
afraid to continue the search for the buried treasure,
he (Godfrey) was not afraid either; but remembering
that Dan was to be kept in ignorance of the arrangements
he had made with the general&#8217;s nephew, he
checked himself in time, and again desired the boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
to bring out his rifle. Godfrey did not intend to
shoot at old Jordan&#8217;s apparition if he saw it. He
only wanted to take the weapon with him because he
felt safer while it was in his hands. He loaded it
very carefully when his son brought it out, and
placing it on his shoulder started off, Dan keeping
close by his side.</p>

<p>Godfrey was by no means as much at his ease as
he seemed to be, and had it been after sunset, he
could not have been hired to venture near the general&#8217;s
lane after what he had heard. He considered
that he was about to do a very reckless thing, but he
kept resolutely on, and finally reached the barn.
The wide doors that gave entrance into the lane
stood open, but the building was deserted by all living
things save the horses and a few chickens, and
an unearthly silence seemed to brood over it. Godfrey
dared not enter. He walked up close to the
threshold, and stretching out his long neck, peeped
into every corner. While he was thus engaged, a
smothered exclamation from Dan caused him to
straighten up as suddenly as if he had been shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Laws a massy!&#8221; cried Dan. &#8220;Thar he is agin!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, my soul!&#8221; ejaculated Godfrey, shivering all
over.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>He looked around, and saw the object of his search
coming down the lane toward the barn. Just one
look was enough for Godfrey, and in that one look
he took in everything about the apparition; for such
he believed it to be. He remembered old Jordan so
well that he would have recognised him on the instant
if he had seen him in Asia. Here he was now before
his very eyes. There could be no mistake about it.
The peculiar style of progression, the clothes, the
manner in which he handled his cane, and the whole
appearance of the approaching object, all proclaimed
that it could be none other than the missing Jordan.
Godfrey did not wait for him to come any nearer.
Quickly shouldering his rifle he darted through the
barn, out at the back door, and ran for his life, paying
no heed to the frantic appeals to &#8220;wait a minute,&#8221;
which the terrified Dan shouted after him. He made
his way across the general&#8217;s grounds to the lake, the
shore of which he followed until he came to the
woods; and there he sat down on a log to recover
his breath, and to wait for Dan.</p>

<p>The latter came at last, and his first act was to
take his father to task for deserting him in so cowardly
a manner. Godfrey had nothing to say in reply.
Forgetting that the boy had been just as anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
as himself to get safely out of sight of the apparition,
he asked a good many questions, hoping to
learn what old Jordan had done, where he had gone,
and whether or not he had said anything; but on
these points Dan could give him no information.
The two went home together, and passed the remainder
of the day in a state of mind that can hardly be
described. When night came Godfrey did not sit
on his bench as usual; he stayed in the house, never
once giving a thought to Clarence Gordon, who was
waiting for him at his uncle&#8217;s barn. He kept a bright
blaze in the fire-place, so that the interior might be
lighted up as much as possible. When he got ready
to go to bed he took pains to fasten the door securely&mdash;and
that was a thing he had never been known to
do before&mdash;and to place his rifle close by the head of
the &#8220;shake-down,&#8221; so that it could be readily seized
in case of emergency.</p>

<p>The next morning he ate but little breakfast, and
seemed to be greatly relieved when he could sit on
the bench with his pipe. He smoked and meditated
for two hours (during this time all the members of
his family had gone off about their usual vocations&mdash;Mrs.
Evans to work at the house of a neighbor,
David to the fields to continue the education of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
pointer, and Dan to the woods, to spend the day in
shooting squirrels and making a pretence of building
turkey-traps)&mdash;and was then aroused by the appearance
of Clarence Gordon, who was the very person
he most wished to see. The boy carried his rifle in
the hollow of his arm, and, as before, stopped near
the cabin to bring a squirrel out of one of the tall
trees growing by the roadside. Godfrey hastened to
meet him, and was greeted with:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a nice fellow to keep a promise, are you
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Clarence, have they heard of it up to the
Gordons?&#8221; asked Godfrey, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an awful row up there among the negroes
about a ghost, or some such nonsense, if that&#8217;s what
you mean,&#8221; answered Clarence. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t a
black man or woman on the plantation that can be
hired to go near the barn, and my uncle is afraid all
his hands are going to leave him to gather his crops
as best he can. But, of course, that wasn&#8217;t what
kept you away last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon it was jest that very thing,&#8221; said Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re a coward and ought to be heartily
ashamed of yourself. That&#8217;s my opinion of <i>you</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>Godfrey jumped up and knocked his heels together,
coming down with his feet spread out and his fists
doubled up, as he always did when he was angry and
about to say something very emphatic. But when
he had done this much he stopped short, for he saw
that he had not frightened the boy in the least. He
had only surprised him. Clarence had never before
seen a backwoods fighter limber up his joints previous
to going into action.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you mean by that?&#8221; he asked,
coolly.</p>

<p>Godfrey did not think it best to say that he had
been getting ready to punish the boy for calling him
a coward, so he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had seed it yourself, Mr. Clarence, what
would you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that thing you call a haunt? I
never saw one, and there are none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know better; kase thar is,&#8221; said Godfrey,
earnestly. &#8220;I seed it myself with my own two eyes
in broad daylight, an&#8217; so did Dannie an&#8217; three or four
of the gen&#8217;ral&#8217;s niggers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it is very strange that no one else could
see it,&#8221; said Clarence. &#8220;My aunt wanted to take
Marsh and me out riding yesterday afternoon, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the hostler wouldn&#8217;t hitch up because he was afraid
to go near the barn; so uncle, and Don, and Bert,
and I went out there and searched high and low for
the thing that had frightened him, and could find
nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In course you couldn&#8217;t, kase it&#8217;s a haunt. Nobody
can&#8217;t see &#8217;em, &#8217;ceptin&#8217; when they wants to be
seed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; exclaimed Clarence. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
suppose there was a man in this day and age of the
world who would talk as you do. Did you see any
thing yesterday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sar, I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw it <i>yourself</i>, did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I done seed it my own self.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did it look like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looked jest as ole Jordan did the last time I
seed him, afore he run away with the Yanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you can safely bet it <i>was</i> he&mdash;not his
&#8216;haunt,&#8217; as you call it, but he, himself, in his own
proper person. If you had taken hold of him you
would have found solid bone and muscle in your
hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Godfrey, solemnly. &#8220;I
had my rifle in my hands, an&#8217; if I had drawed a bead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
on him, the bullet would have gone through him as
slick as grease, an&#8217; never hurt him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence stamped his foot impatiently. &#8220;It is
well you didn&#8217;t try it,&#8221; said he. &#8220;If you had, you
would now be in jail with a good chance of being
tried for a very serious offence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you reckon it was ole Jordan hisself?&#8221; asked
Godfrey, who seemed to be impressed by the boy&#8217;s
arguments.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it was,&#8221; said Clarence.</p>

<p>&#8220;We all thought he was dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s no uncommon thing for people to be
mistaken, is it? If he were dead how could he come
back here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you reckon he&#8217;s come back for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You tell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; if it was him, his own self, what was the
reason he didn&#8217;t speak to nobody? He knowed two
of the niggers that was thar, an&#8217; he knowed me.
&#8217;Tain&#8217;t likely he&#8217;d &#8217;member Dannie, kase the boy was
too leetle when he went away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer the question yourself,&#8221; replied Clarence.
&#8220;You are as good at guessing as I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, if it&#8217;s him, his own self, I wish he hadn&#8217;t
come back,&#8221; said Godfrey.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t, for I intend to make use of him. The
old fellow is not above earning a dime or two, is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never yet seed the man that was, black or
white,&#8221; said Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall make it my business to scrape an
acquaintance with the old fellow, if I can find him,
and ask him if he&#8217;d like to make a thousand dollars.
He&#8217;ll say &#8216;yes,&#8217; of course; and then I&#8217;ll tell him that
all he has got to do to have the money paid right
over to him, is to show me where he hid that barrel
before he ran away with the Yankees.&#8221;</p>

<p>Godfrey backed toward the bench and looked at
Clarence without speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he will do it&mdash;and I know I should if I were
in his place&mdash;I shall be glad he has come back,&#8221;
continued Clarence. &#8220;I took a good look at that
potato-patch yesterday, and I tell you there&#8217;s a lot
of ground in it. It will take us till doomsday to
dig it full of holes four or five feet deep, and I can&#8217;t
wait so long. I need the money now&mdash;to-day!&#8221;</p>

<p>Godfrey looked at Clarence from head to foot,
taking in at a glance all the fashionable and expensive
trappings he had about him, both useful and
ornamental, and wondered why he should be so much
in need of money. If he had possessed the cash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
value of the boy&#8217;s gold watch and chain he would
have been very well contented, and would have
thought no more about the barrel and its contents
while he had ten dollars of it remaining.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t you suppose that if you were to hang
around uncle&#8217;s barn for a while, you could gain an
interview with old Jordan?&#8221; asked Clarence.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sar,&#8221; answered Godfrey, hastily. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t see him again fur no money. An&#8217; right
here&#8217;s one thing that mebbe ye didn&#8217;t think of:
Wouldn&#8217;t he be an ole fule to go an&#8217; show ye whar
that thar bar&#8217;l is, an&#8217; get only a thousand dollars fur
it, when he could go and dig it up by hisself an&#8217; take
it all&mdash;the hul eighty thousand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have thought of that,&#8221; said Clarence, &#8220;and
have made up my mind what I shall do in case he
refuses to help me. Mark my words: If I get my
hands on that old nigger, I&#8217;ll find out where that
barrel is, if he knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was all Clarence would say on this point just
then. His companion tried hard to make him explain
himself, but all Clarence would say was, that
he had a way of finding out things he wanted to know,
and with that Godfrey was obliged to be content.
Before separating they made another agreement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
which was that they would meet that night, as soon
as it was fairly dark, at the summer-house on the
shore of the lake. Godfrey appointed the place of
meeting himself, saying that he would not go near
the general&#8217;s barn again if he had an army at his
back. He promised, moreover, to meet Clarence
there every night, and to faithfully assist him in
prosecuting the search until the barrel was found.
If Clarence succeeded in obtaining an interview with
the old negro and finding out where the eighty
thousand dollars were hidden, so much the better;
but that was a matter with which Godfrey himself
would have nothing to do.</p>

<p>That was another long day to Godfrey. When he
had leisure to calmly think over the promise he had
made, he wondered how he had dared do it; and as
the afternoon waned and the hour appointed for the
meeting at the summer-house drew nearer, he became
really alarmed, and was several times on the point
of making up his mind that he would stay at home.
But he did not stay at home. He went, agreeably to
promise, and for half an hour sat in the summer-house
starting at the rustle of every leaf and holding
himself in readiness to take to his heels at the first
sight of anything that might look like old Jordan&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
white coat. When at last Clarence arrived, he was
so overjoyed to see him, that he seized his hand and
shook it until the boy forcibly withdrew it from his
grasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t get away any sooner,&#8221; said Clarence.
&#8220;We were having some music up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they say anything about the haunt?&#8221; asked
Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they didn&#8217;t say anything about that, for they
have sense enough to know that there is no such
thing in the world,&#8221; said Clarence, impatiently.
&#8220;They talked about old Jordan, and uncle seems to
think he has come back; but he says it is very
strange that the old fellow doesn&#8217;t show himself
about the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Mr. Clarence,&#8221; said Godfrey, suddenly;
&#8220;mebbe he&#8217;s come back on purpose to dig up the
bar&#8217;l hisself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought of that,&#8221; replied the boy. &#8220;But if
that was his object, he wouldn&#8217;t be so foolish as to
show himself to anybody. He has kept out of my
way so far. Don and I have been about the barn
all the afternoon watching for him. If I once get
my eyes on him I&#8217;ll see what he&#8217;s made of, unless he
shows that he can run faster than I can.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>&#8220;What does Mr. Don think about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, he&#8217;s like the rest. He don&#8217;t know what to
think about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he ever say anything to ye about the bar&#8217;l?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; he said just enough to make me think that
the barrel is there. I pumped him to-day, and he
said in so many words that Jordan hid a barrel of
stuff somewhere, and hinted that none of the family
ever dug it up. I heard enough to make me determined
to go ahead, even if I have to dig up the whole
of that potato-patch by myself. If you are ready
we&#8217;ll go. I have placed a couple of shovels where I
can find them.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying Clarence led the way toward the potato-patch,
and Godfrey tremblingly followed. The shovels
were found, and the two, after walking a short distance
along the fence that separated the garden from
the potato-patch, were about to climb over into the
field where their operations were to be conducted,
when Godfrey suddenly laid his hand on his companion&#8217;s
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Laws a massy! What&#8217;s that, Mr. Clarence?&#8221;
said he, in a suppressed whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s what?&#8221; demanded the boy, who, in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of his boasted courage, shivered as if he had been
unexpectedly plunged into a bath of ice-water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark a minute!&#8221; said Godfrey. &#8220;Don&#8217;t ye
hear it now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence held his breath and listened intently.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<small>OLD JORDAN IN TROUBLE.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;I &nbsp;DO hear it,&#8221; said Clarence, as soon as he caught
the sound that had attracted Godfrey&#8217;s attention.
&#8220;There&#8217;s some one digging out there in the field.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s jest what it is,&#8221; said Godfrey, in a trembling
voice. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s go no further, Mr. Clarence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of being afraid?&#8221; returned the
boy. &#8220;It is a man, of course, for if it were anything
else it couldn&#8217;t use a shovel. You are not afraid of
a man, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>No, there was no man in that part of the country
that Godfrey was afraid to meet on equal terms; and
to prove it he laid down his shovel, clenched his
hands and jumped up and knocked his heels together.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean by that nonsense,&#8221;
said Clarence, impatiently. &#8220;If you are afraid, go
home; if you are not, come along with me!&#8221;</p>

<p>As the boy said this he placed his hands on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
top rail of the fence and vaulted lightly over it,
closely followed by Godfrey, who touched the ground
on the opposite side almost as soon as Clarence did.
Side by side they moved cautiously in the direction
from which the sound of the digging came, and after
advancing a short distance, Godfrey threw himself
flat on his face to make some investigations. The
night being very dark, of course all objects on the
ground were invisible to them; but by placing themselves
in such a position that they would have the
lighter sky for a background, any object they wished
to examine was rendered quite distinct to their gaze.
This they both proceeded to do, Clarence following
Godfrey&#8217;s example, and when they arose to their
feet again a few seconds later and compared notes,
they found that both had arrived at the same conclusion&mdash;that
there was a man in the field but a few
rods away from them, and that he was digging a hole
with a shovel. He had gone down so deep already
that his legs as far as his knees were concealed, and
that proved that he had not come there to steal
potatoes. Was he looking for the barrel? If so,
who was he, and how did he find out that there was
any barrel there?</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; whispered Clarence, as these thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
passed through his mind. &#8220;We&#8217;ll soon know all
about it. Be careful not to make the least noise.
If he starts to run go after him and bring him back.
We must find out who he is, and what he means by
this business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Guided by the strokes of the shovel, which fell
upon their ears at regular intervals, Clarence and
his companion slowly and cautiously drew nearer to
the workman, who, greatly to their surprise, never
paid the least attention to their approach. He must
have heard the squeaking of Clarence&#8217;s boots&mdash;they
would squeak, no matter how carefully he stepped&mdash;and
the rustle of the dry grass and vines that covered
the potato-hills, but he was not frightened from his
work. Finally Clarence was near enough to him to
lay hold of his arm. Even then the man never looked
up or ceased his work, and Clarence began to feel a
he had never felt before. His heart beat rapidly
and all his strength seemed to be leaving him, but
he managed to say, in a very steady voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, young fellow, this sort of game won&#8217;t
work with us, you know. Come up out of that hole
and let&#8217;s see who you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, my soul!&#8221; exclaimed Godfrey, who had
stooped down to obtain a peep at the man&#8217;s face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
&#8220;Turn him loose, Mr. Clarence! That&#8217;s ole Jordan&#8217;s
haunt! I&#8217;d know that ole white coat anywhar.
O, my sakes alive!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back here!&#8221; said Clarence, in much the
same tone that he would have used had he been
addressing a disobedient hound. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare
run away, unless you want General Gordon to know
all about this.&#8221;</p>

<p>These words were spoken just in time. In a
moment more Godfrey would have been scudding
across the field at the top of his speed. Tremblingly
he approached Clarence, and had there been light
enough to enable him to distinguish his features, the
boy would have seen that they were as white as a
sheet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You gave me to understand that you are not
afraid of any man in the country,&#8221; continued the
latter. &#8220;Now prove it. Reach out your hand and
take hold of this fellow&#8217;s arm; and if you don&#8217;t feel
solid flesh in your grasp, you may take yourself off
as soon as you please!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it a man?&#8221; gasped Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it is. Come here and see for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t he say somethin&#8217;, then?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>&#8220;I suppose it is because he don&#8217;t want to. Come
here and take hold of him, and we&#8217;ll soon find means
to make him use his tongue, if he has one!&#8221;</p>

<p>Very reluctantly Godfrey obeyed the command.
He extended his hand and made a grasp at the prisoner&#8217;s
arm, fully expecting that his fingers would
pass through it as they would pass through the air;
but to his surprise and intense relief his grasp closed
upon a small but very compact bunch of muscle. He
seized it firmly and held fast to it, and then his courage
all returned, and he was as brave as Clarence
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said the latter, &#8220;I want to take a good
look at this fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Striking a match on the sleeve of his coat as he
spoke, he examined the man by the aid of the light
it threw out, and saw that he was a coal-black negro,
and that he was dressed in a suit of something that
had once been white, but which was patched with
so many different kinds of cloth that it was hard to
find any of the original material in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you old Jordan?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>There was no answer returned by the negro, who
was as passive in the hands of his captors as if he
had been a lump of clay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>&#8220;This won&#8217;t do, old fellow,&#8221; said Clarence, angrily.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t play off on us in this way. You
had better open your mouth, or we&#8217;ll take you straight
to the general. Perhaps he can find means to make
you tell what you are doing in his potato-patch at
this time of night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, that ain&#8217;t no way to talk to a nigger, Mr.
Clarence,&#8221; said Godfrey. &#8220;I knows who he is, an&#8217;
I can soon make him speak,&#8221; he added, drawing back
his shovel preparatory to punching old Jordan in the
ribs with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hol&#8217; on dar, boss!&#8221; cried the prisoner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thar, now, what did I tell ye?&#8221; exclaimed Godfrey,
triumphantly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t sound much like ole
Jordan&#8217;s voice, though!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that you have found your tongue, I want
to talk to you,&#8221; said Clarence. &#8220;Would you like to
make a thousand dollars?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to make a heap more&#8217;n dat, boss,&#8221;
replied the negro.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are? How are you going to do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jordan,&#8221; said Godfrey, &#8220;did you come back to
dig up that thar bar&#8217;l you kivered up here in this
tater-patch on the day the Yanks cut the levee?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s tellin&#8217;,&#8221; replied the negro.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>&#8220;Do you know where the barrel is?&#8221; asked Clarence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Course he does,&#8221; exclaimed Godfrey, &#8220;kase
he&#8217;s the one that kivered it up. Whar is it, Jordan?
Pint out the spot, an&#8217; ye shall go free without no
harm bein&#8217; done to ye; but if ye don&#8217;t tell&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hol&#8217; on dar, boss!&#8221; cried the old negro, as Godfrey
once more drew back his spade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know where the barrel is?&#8221; asked Clarence.
&#8220;Answer that question!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon I does, boss!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, where is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, I didn&#8217;t say I&#8217;d tell dat, did I? It &#8217;longs
to my ole marse, Gen&#8217;ral Gordon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got more&#8217;n his share already,&#8221; said Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Den I reckon I&#8217;se got jest as much right to dat
bar&#8217;l an&#8217; what&#8217;s into it, as anybody,&#8221; said the negro;
&#8220;mebbe more, kase I&#8217;se the one that hid it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on a minute, Godfrey,&#8221; said Clarence, as
his companion raised the shovel threateningly. &#8220;Step
this way, a moment. Old man, you stay right where
you are. If you make any attempt to run, I&#8217;ll throw
this shovel at you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence and Godfrey drew off on one side, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
out of ear-shot of the negro, and the former said, in
a suppressed whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure that&#8217;s old Jordan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as sure as I can be,&#8221; replied Godfrey.
&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t his haunt&mdash;I can see that now&mdash;but ole
Jordan his own self.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you are so positive, for there is something
about this business that doesn&#8217;t look just right
to me. If it is he, he has come back to dig up that
barrel himself. I wonder if it is somewhere about
the spot where he was digging! How are we going
to make him tell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lick it outen him,&#8221; suggested Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, that would never do in the world. He&#8217;d
raise the neighborhood with his howling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, mebbe goin&#8217; without grub an&#8217; water fur a
few hours will loosen up his tongue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the idea,&#8221; said Clarence, joyfully. &#8220;No
one will miss him, for those who have seen him since
he came back think he is a ghost. Where can we
take him and keep him safe until he tells us what we
want to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon my tater-hole is as good a place as
any,&#8221; said Godfrey, after thinking a moment. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
don&#8217;t have nothing to put in it now, an&#8217; nobody ever
goes nigh it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we lock him up there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but we can tie him up, an&#8217; that will do jest
as well. Howsomever, I don&#8217;t much keer to go into
any sich business as that, Mr. Clarence. S&#8217;pose it
should come out on us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How in the world is it going to come out on us?&#8221;
asked Clarence, impatiently. &#8220;You&#8217;ll not tell, will
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sar,&#8221; answered Godfrey, with great emphasis.
&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t live here if I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I shall not tell, either. You may be sure
of that; so I don&#8217;t see how it can become known.
We can starve old Jordan into opening his mouth,
and when he gets ready to tell us where the barrel
is, we&#8217;ll dig it up, divide the contents, and the first
boat that comes along will take me away from here.
I don&#8217;t care whether I go up or down the river, so
long as I have my pockets full of money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; what&#8217;ll I do?&#8221; asked Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can do as you please. You want to stay
here and spend your share, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;ll I do with the nigger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you do with him,&#8221; was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
boy&#8217;s mental reply. &#8220;So long as I get safely away
from here, you and the nigger can settle the business
between you in any way you see fit. That is a matter
in which I am not interested.&#8221; But aloud he said:
&#8220;O, we&#8217;ll get rid of him somehow. We&#8217;ll think about
that when the time comes. Now, we&#8217;ll give old Jordan
one more chance to earn his freedom, and if he
doesn&#8217;t see fit to improve it, it is no fault of ours. He
will have to go to the potato-hole and be tied up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Godfrey was not at all pleased with this arrangement,
and he wondered why he had been foolish
enough to suggest it. As much as he wanted to be
rich, he would never have dared, had he been left to
himself, to resort to such desperate measures as these
to gain his object. The thought of it was enough to
make him tremble. He wished he had never seen
Clarence, or had anything to do with him. The boy
was so determined to go through with what he had
begun, and seemed to be so utterly reckless of consequences,
that Godfrey was really afraid of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Mr. Clarence,&#8221; said he, suddenly, &#8220;I &#8217;most
done forgot it, but it&#8217;s the gospel truth, an&#8217; I hope I
may be shot if it hain&#8217;t, that that tater-hole of mine
has done fell in, an&#8217; ain&#8217;t no more account fur tyin&#8217; up
niggers in. &#8217;Sides, I hain&#8217;t got no ropes of no kind.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>&#8220;All right, Godfrey,&#8221; said Clarence, who saw
very plainly what his companion was trying to get at.
&#8220;We will find out about that when we get there.
But let me tell you one thing: If you think you are
going to back out and leave me in the lurch, you are
very much mistaken. If you will stick to me and
do as I say, we shall both of us come out all right;
but if you desert me, there&#8217;ll be a breeze raised here
in this neighborhood that will make you think that
war times have come back, sure enough. Now,
Jordan,&#8221; he added, addressing the negro, &#8220;will you
tell me where that barrel is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sar!&mdash;no, <i>sar</i>!&#8221; said the old man, shaking
his head most decidedly. &#8220;Nobody gets dat bar&#8217;l
an&#8217; what&#8217;s into it &#8217;ceptin&#8217; ole Jordan!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Come with us, and we will see if
we can find means to make you think differently.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence seized the old negro by one arm, as he
spoke, Godfrey at a sign from him took hold of the
other, and together they led him across the field until
they reached the road, down which they conducted
him toward Godfrey&#8217;s cabin. But little was said
during the walk. The negro, who was evidently
becoming alarmed, would have talked fast enough,
but when his captors allowed him to use his tongue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
he pitched his voice in so high a key that Clarence,
alarmed lest he should arouse somebody, sternly
ordered him to hold his peace. The old negro
changed his tactics now, and most solemnly declared
that he didn&#8217;t know anything about any barrel; that
his name was not Jordan; and that he had gone into
the field simply for the purpose of stealing some
potatoes for his breakfast. But Clarence only laughed
at this, and assured him that he was not taking the
right course to gain his liberty. Potatoes didn&#8217;t
grow three feet under ground, he said, and neither
did prowlers, as a general thing, dig them with a
shovel. They could do better work with their hands.
If he would go back there and show them where the
barrel was hidden, they would dig for it, and the
moment they found it they would give him something
for pocket-money, and release him. This the
old negro protested he could not do, and Clarence
assured him that he should do it before he saw daylight
again.</p>

<p>Half an hour&#8217;s walk brought them within sight
of the cabin, and there Godfrey left Clarence and
the prisoner while he went forward to make sure that
none of his family were stirring, and to secure a
plough-line that hung up under the shed beside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
corn-crib, that being the article with which he had
decided to confine old Jordan. He returned in a
few minutes, and once more taking hold of the
negro&#8217;s arm, he and Clarence assisted him over two
or three fences, through a thick brier-patch which
covered the site of his former comfortable dwelling,
and finally halted in front of the potato-hole. It
was simply an out-door cellar, the peak of the roof
rising to the height of one&#8217;s shoulder, and the eaves
resting on the ground. The cellar was quite deep
enough to permit a tall man to stand upright in it,
as Clarence found when he descended the stairs that
led into it. It had successfully resisted the ravages
of time, and with the exception of the steps, which
were in a very dilapidated state, was as sound as it
was on the day it was built. The roof was four feet
thick, and Godfrey assured his companion that the
prisoner might shout for help as long and as loudly
as he pleased, but he could not make himself heard
as far as the cabin, unless he possessed lungs with as
much power as a steam-whistle.</p>

<p>Clarence now renewed his efforts to induce the
negro to tell where the barrel with the eighty thousand
dollars in it was hidden; but the latter declared
that he did not know; and Clarence, losing all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
patience, assisted Godfrey in tying him fast to one
of the stanchions that supported the roof. When
this was done he felt his way out of the cellar&mdash;it
was as dark as Egypt in there&mdash;and Godfrey closed
and latched the door behind him. They both
breathed easier when the work was over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Godfrey,&#8221; said Clarence, &#8220;your potato-hole
seems to be in pretty good condition yet; and
you did manage to find something to tie the old nigger
with after all, didn&#8217;t you? Now remember that
it will not be safe for us to go near him during the
daytime; some one might see us. We must give
this cellar a wide berth for twenty-four hours. If
the old fellow goes that length of time without anything
to eat or drink, perhaps he will begin to think
that we are in earnest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Godfrey made no reply. His heart was not in
the business, and he wished himself safely out of it.
Having gone so far, however, there was no way of
retreat. If old Jordan were released, he would be
certain to tell of the treatment he had received, and
that would bring him and Clarence into serious trouble.
He scarcely heard his companion&#8217;s cheerful
good-night, so engrossed was he with his own gloomy
thoughts.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>Having taken leave of Godfrey, Clarence walked
rapidly toward his uncle&#8217;s house, little dreaming what
a commotion the events of this night were destined
to create there. He was not nearly so light-hearted
as he pretended to be. Now that he had time to
think calmly about what he had done, he was frightened,
and wondered how he had ever had the hardihood
to engage in so reckless a piece of business.
&#8220;No matter,&#8221; said he, trying his best to banish all
his dismal forebodings, &#8220;twenty-four hours in that
cellar will bring the old nigger to his senses; and
when I once get my hands on the money in that barrel,
I&#8217;ll bid good-by to America for a while. Forty
thousand dollars! Whew! This is the only chance I
shall ever have to make a fortune, and I am determined
to improve it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arriving at his uncle&#8217;s house at last, he stopped
for a few minutes to compose himself and calm the
excitement which he knew must be plainly visible in
his face, and then with all the nonchalance of which
he was master, he opened the door and went in. He
stopped in the hall to hang up his cap, and would
have given anything he possessed, if he could have
found some plausible excuse for going at once to his
room. There was a merry family gathering in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
back parlor, and he did not want to go in there.
Some one was playing on the piano, and the rest
were engaged in most agreeable conversation, if one
might judge by the peals of laughter that now and
then rang through the house. Clarence was hardly
fit to go among them, he told himself as he glanced
at the little mirror in the hat-rack. His hair was
disheveled, his face flushed, and his boots and clothes
were covered with dust. While he was making some
hasty improvements in his appearance, his Aunt
Mary came into the hall. She had heard him enter
and came out to meet him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in here, truant, and give an account of
yourself,&#8221; said she, pleasantly. &#8220;What do you mean
by deserting us every night in this unceremonious
manner? Clarence,&#8221; said she, shaking her finger at
him, and sinking her voice almost to a whisper,
&#8220;you&#8217;ve been smoking again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; said the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you find a cigar so much more agreeable
than the society of your friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am; but I have been in the habit of it
so long, you know; and it is hard to give it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it is; but persevere and remember
that &#8216;he that ruleth his spirit is better than he that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
taketh a city.&#8217; Where&#8217;s Don? I thought he was
with you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure I don&#8217;t know. I haven&#8217;t seen him
since supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why that is very strange,&#8221; said Mrs. Gordon.
&#8220;He has been out for the last two or three nights
until nine or ten o&#8217;clock, and I don&#8217;t know what to
think about it. Come in, now. Lucy has been
waiting to practise the Sharpshooter&#8217;s Waltz with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Much against his will Clarence was led into the
parlor, and the curious glances which all his relatives
directed toward him as he entered made him feel very
uncomfortable. His uncle thought he acted ill at
ease; Bert&#8217;s mental comment was that he had been
running a race with somebody; and Marshall told
himself that he must have been rolled in a dust heap.
Clarence could tell by the expression on their faces
pretty nearly what they were thinking about, and it
was with great effort that he aroused himself sufficiently
to take any interest in what was going on.
He played several tunes on his flute while his cousin
Lucy accompanied him on the piano, and as soon as
he could do so with any show of reason, he bade the
company good-night and went to bed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know where in the world you have
spent your evenings since you have been here,&#8221; said
Marshall, when he joined him in his room half an
hour later. &#8220;Just as soon as it grows dark you&#8217;re
off, and that&#8217;s the last we see of you until ten o&#8217;clock.
Have you found a billiard saloon anywhere?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you had better watch me, if you are so
very anxious to find out where I go,&#8221; growled
Clarence, in reply. &#8220;I am bored to death with this
everlasting music, and it is a great pity if I can&#8217;t
now and then take a quiet stroll and a cigar without
exciting astonishment and setting the whole family
to questioning me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence slept but little that night, for his mind
was in a very unsettled state; and a dread of impending
evil, which he could not shake off, continually
haunted him. The first words he exchanged with
the first person he met the next morning, gave him
new cause for alarm. That person was Bert, whom
he encountered just as he stepped into the hall.
His cousin&#8217;s face was very pale, and Clarence saw
that he carried his whip in his hand and was dressed
for a ride.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, Clarence!&#8221; cried Bert. &#8220;What do you think
has become of Don?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>Clarence could only look the surprise which this
abrupt question occasioned him. At the same time
he felt a sinking at his heart for which he could not
account.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t at home at all last night,&#8221; continued
Bert. &#8220;We&#8217;ve made inquiries everywhere, and the
last person who saw him was the hostler, who says
that Don went into the barn about eight o&#8217;clock, but
he didn&#8217;t see him come out again. Father and I are
just about to start off to look for him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence was too amazed to speak. He hurried
out of the house and to the barn, where he found his
uncle in the act of mounting his horse. There were
two other persons in the barn&mdash;the hostler and Godfrey
Evans. The hostler was putting the saddle on
Bert&#8217;s pony, and Godfrey stood around looking the
very picture of misery. He brightened up when he
saw Clarence approaching.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Godfrey,&#8221; said the general, &#8220;will you do
that much for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sar, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll start now,&#8221; answered Godfrey,
who made a few rapid steps toward the gate, and
then suddenly stopped, faced about and came back
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know the woods like a book,&#8221; continued the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
general, &#8220;and if Don is lost, you will be more likely
to find him than anybody else. Good-morning,
Clarence! I don&#8217;t suppose you can tell me anything
about Don, can you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, I am sorry to say I cannot,&#8221; replied
Clarence, who felt that sinking at his heart again
when he looked at Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has lately fallen into the habit of roaming
about of nights,&#8221; said the general, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t know
how to account for it. The boy is large enough to
take care of himself, but I don&#8217;t think he would stay
away so long unless he were in trouble. I am going
down the road to see if I can get any tidings of him;
Bert is going out into the country; Godfrey has promised
to search the woods; and if you feel like it, you
might jump on Don&#8217;s pony and ride down the river
road a few miles. Everybody down there knows Don,
and if he went that way before dark last night, some
one must have seen him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence replied that he would willingly do all in
his power to find the missing boy, and then Bert and
his father mounted their horses and galloped out of
the gate. Godfrey slunk away behind the corn-crib,
and Clarence, after telling the hostler to put a
saddle on Don&#8217;s pony, followed him. He found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Godfrey sitting on the ground and rocking himself
back and forth as if he were in great pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; demanded Clarence,
and it was only by a great effort of will that he
could bring himself to speak at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, my soul!&#8221; cried Godfrey. &#8220;Does yer know
what we&#8217;ve been an&#8217; done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I know what we&#8217;ve done?&#8221; repeated the boy.
&#8220;What do you mean? Speak out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, my soul, how can I?&#8221; moaned Godfrey.
&#8220;Thar&#8217;s the gen&#8217;ral axin&#8217; me would I s&#8217;arch the
woods to find that lost boy of his&#8217;n, an&#8217; thar he is,
this blessed minute, tied up hard an&#8217; fast in my own
tater-hole. O, laws! O, laws!&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence reeled and fell heavily against the corn-crib,
as if some one had unexpectedly dealt him a
stunning blow.</p>

<small>HOW CLARENCE FOUND IT OUT.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">CLARENCE and his brother had not been under
their uncle&#8217;s roof more than two or three hours
before they found that they had been sadly mistaken in
regard to some opinions they had formed, and Marshall
was honest enough to acknowledge the fact, at
least to himself. The &#8220;country bumpkins,&#8221; as Clarence
had sneeringly called his cousins, proved to be
educated young gentlemen, who, before the day was
over, put their dashing city relatives to the blush on
more than one occasion, and forced them to confess
that all the knowledge in the world was not to be
gained by simply travelling about Europe. Don and
Bert exerted themselves to the utmost to entertain
their visitors, and so did all the other members of the
family; and they succeeded so well that Marshall
told himself that perhaps his forced sojourn in the
country would not turn out to be so very unpleasant
after all. But Clarence, being entirely out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
his element, was homesick already, and consequently
could take no interest in anything. He cared little
for such amusements and pastimes as were to be found
in a happy cultivated family circle. He preferred a
game of billiards or cards with some boon companions,
and these he could not have so long as he remained
under his uncle&#8217;s roof.</p>

<p>The day was a long and dreary one to him. He
played a few times on his flute while his cousin Lucy
accompanied him on the piano; spent an hour or two
in walking about the plantation; listened patiently,
but without much interest, while Don and Bert talked
of the various exciting and amusing incidents that
had happened in the neighborhood during the war;
and as soon as night came and he could find an
opportunity to do so, he slipped away by himself.
He wanted to be alone, so that he could think over
the plans he had formed for bringing his visit to a
speedy termination, and make up his mind what sort
of a letter he would write to his mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no fun to be seen here,&#8221; said Clarence,
as he drew a cigar from one pocket and a match-safe
from another. &#8220;I can see that with half an eye,
and I can&#8217;t endure the thought of staying here for
six long months. I&#8217;d do almost anything to raise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
money enough to take me away from here this very
night. Now, what can I say to mother, in the letter
I intend to write to her before I go to bed, that will
induce her to send me fifty dollars without an hour&#8217;s
delay?&#8221;</p>

<p>As Clarence asked himself this question he lighted
his cigar, and finding that a fence ran across his
path, and that he was at such a distance from the
house that he could enjoy his smoke without fear of
interruption, he leaned on the top rail and went off
into a reverie, from which he was aroused a few minutes
later by the sound of voices and footsteps.
Hastily taking his cigar from his mouth and putting
it behind him, he looked up and saw a couple of figures
advancing toward him along the fence. It was
so dark that he could not see who they were, but it
flashed upon him that perhaps they were Don and
Bert, who were out searching for him. With an
exclamation indicative of great annoyance and vexation,
he was about to throw away his cigar, when
some words spoken in a suppressed tone of voice fell
upon his ear and arrested his hand.</p>

<p>By this time the approaching figures were so close
to him that Clarence made out that they were a man
and a boy; and from their conversation he learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
that they had come there to dig up a barrel. Clarence
caught every word they uttered, and could scarcely
restrain his astonishment when he heard the man
say:</p>

<p>&#8220;He done a good thing fur us, ole Jordan did,
when he run away without tellin&#8217; his missus whar
that bar&#8217;l was hid. Now, Dannie, let&#8217;s try right
here fust. Ye begin, kase yer the youngest, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll
set down an&#8217; smoke an&#8217; watch ye till yer tired.
Now, bar in mind that yer workin&#8217; fur eighty
thousand dollars! Throw it out with the fust
shovelful, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll give ye half!&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence almost jumped from the ground when he
heard this, and, like the quick-witted fellow he was,
he comprehended the situation perfectly; but we
ought to say that he had something besides the conversation
to which he had just listened, to aid him
in reaching the conclusions he so suddenly formed.
During the day his aunt had shown him several
articles of value that had long been heir-looms in the
Gordon family, and explained to him how she had
managed to keep them secreted during the war.
The family silver had been buried again and again&mdash;every
time, in fact, that there was the least rumor
of an advance being made by either army&mdash;and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
work, for the most part, had been done by some of
the negroes on the plantation.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good many people lost property in that
way which they never recovered,&#8221; said his aunt.
&#8220;The negroes, having concealed it, ran away with
the Federals without leaving any clue to the hiding-place
of the valuables, and so they were never found.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence had not thought much of this at the time,
but he thought of it now, and by connecting it with
the words that had just been uttered in his hearing,
he arrived at a tolerably fair solution of what would
otherwise have been a deep mystery to him. His aunt
had not said so in so many words, but he inferred that
she had lost valuable property in the way she had
explained. Clarence was sure of it now, and he was
almost overwhelmed by the discovery he had made.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eighty thousand dollars!&#8221; said he, to himself.
&#8220;It must be in money, and in gold and silver, too,
for my aunt says that all the wealthy rebels took the
precaution to exchange their bank-notes for specie at
the first beginning of the trouble between the North
and South. I hope to goodness they will find it.
If they do, they can rest assured that they&#8217;ll not get
away with it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The few seconds that Clarence passed in meditating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
and soliloquizing in this way, were employed by
Dan in getting ready for work, and by Godfrey in
picking out a comfortable place to sit down, and in
filling and lighting his pipe. Having discarded his
coat and hat, Dan threw out two or three shovelfuls
of earth; but it was heavy work, and Dan, who got
tired very easily, could not help asking himself how
many such shovelfuls he would have to throw out
before the coveted barrel could be brought to light.
He told his father that ten acres was a great deal of
ground, and Godfrey, to encourage him, reminded
him that there were eighty thousand dollars in gold
and silver buried somewhere about there, and that
they must have it if they were obliged to dig up the
whole state of Mississippi.</p>

<p>It was while Dan was looking all about the field
to see how large it was, that he discovered the lighted
end of Clarence Gordon&#8217;s cigar shining through the
darkness. Clarence was leaning half way over the
fence in his eagerness to hear all that was said, and
smoking furiously, too much interested and excited
to remember that the little coal of fire on the end of
his Havana, which glowed brightly for a moment
and then faded almost entirely away, as he drew in
and puffed out the smoke, could be seen by the parties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
he was watching, should either of them chance
to look that way. We know that they did look that
way, both of them, and that half a minute later the
field was deserted, and Clarence was standing alone
beside the fence.</p>

<p>The boy was utterly amazed at the haste with
which Godfrey and his son took themselves out of
sight, and all unconscious of the fact that he was the
cause of their alarm, he drew himself quickly down
beside a tree that stood in the fence corner, put his
cigar behind him and looked all around, expecting
to see some member of his uncle&#8217;s family or one of
his servants approaching. But there was no one in
sight, and after listening and watching for a few
minutes, Clarence climbed over into the field to see
what progress the two prowlers had made with their
work.</p>

<p>The hope that they might have uncovered the
barrel was very short-lived, for he found that Dan
had made just no headway at all. The hole he had
dug could have been covered up with a hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what in the world it was that frightened
them away,&#8221; said Clarence, in deep perplexity.
&#8220;They were frightened, of course, or they would not
have run as they did after holding that whispered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
consultation. I can&#8217;t see or hear anything alarming,
and I do wish they had stayed long enough to dig
up the barrel. Eighty thousand dollars! If it is to be
found I must have some of it. If I knew where I
could find a shovel, I&#8217;d dig awhile myself. But no
matter. They will probably come back again; if
not to-night then some other night, and I shall be
on hand when the barrel is found, no matter if I
don&#8217;t get a wink of sleep for the next six months.
Hello! what&#8217;s this?&#8221; he added, as his fingers came
in contact with the pipe Godfrey had dropped.</p>

<p>He held it up between him and the sky, and when
he saw what it was, was about to throw it away, when
he thought of something. He held the pipe suspended
in the air a moment, then put it into his
pocket and walked back to his hiding-place again.
He waited and watched there for nearly an hour,
hoping that Godfrey and his son would return, but
being satisfied at last that they had no intention of
coming back that night, and fearing that if he remained
away from the house any longer, somebody
would be out to see what had become of him, he
pitched the stump of his cigar into the bushes and
walked away from the fence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, this is just what I am going to do,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Clarence, who had already thought the matter over
and determined upon his course of action. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to find out who those fellows are, if there is
any possible way for me to do it, and I am going to
say to them: &#8216;Look here, boys; havers!&#8217; If they
say &#8216;Yes,&#8217; well and good. If they say &#8216;No,&#8217; I&#8217;d like
to see them get a cent out of those eighty thousand
dollars. I wish it was morning. I shan&#8217;t sleep a
wink to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first person he met as he entered the hall was
his aunt, who seemed to be waiting for him. She
asked him where he had been passing the evening,
and detecting the smell of tobacco smoke, told him
what he had been doing. Clarence pleaded guilty,
but said that he was homesick and had the blues;
and when he got that way, nothing did him so much
good as a lonely walk and a cigar. But he would
give up the cigar now. He would not smoke any
more.</p>

<p>After a short time spent with the family in music
and conversation, the boys all went up stairs together,
and Don and Bert stopped for a few minutes in their
cousins&#8217; room. Clarence thought this a good opportunity
to find out some things he wanted to know,
so he began questioning Don at once.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>&#8220;Whom do you visit with here?&#8221; said he. &#8220;Who
is your nearest neighbor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, we have a large circle of friends,&#8221; replied
Don. &#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder you think it very lonely
now; but wait until you have had a chance to make
acquaintances, and then tell me what you think
about it. Our nearest neighbor, as you go up the
river, is Colonel Packard. He has two lively boys
whom I think you will like. In fact I don&#8217;t see
how you could help it, for everybody likes them.
Our nearest neighbor, as you go down the river, is
Godfrey Evans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a good one,&#8221; said Bert.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have much to do with him or his family,&#8221;
continued Don, &#8220;and you will know the reason
why when you see them. We give David our
dogs to break, because he is a first-rate hand, and we
want to help him along. He&#8217;s got something in him,
David has, but his father and his older brother, Dan,
don&#8217;t amount to much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dan!&#8221; thought Clarence, becoming highly excited
at once, &#8220;I believe I am on the right track
already. The man who was digging in the field
called the boy that was with him &#8216;Dannie.&#8217;&#8221; Then
believing that it might be well for him to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
something about Godfrey before he sought an interview
with him, he said aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;How far does this man Evans live from here,
and what is his business?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He lives about a mile down the river, and has
no occupation at all,&#8221; answered Don. &#8220;He used to
be in good circumstances, but having lost everything
he possessed, except his land, he is too disheartened
to go to work and put himself on his feet again. He
spends a little of his time in hunting, and a good
deal more in grumbling at his hard luck. He might
make a good living for his family with his rifle, if
he felt so disposed, for game is abundant, and he is
a good hunter and a capital shot; but he is too lazy
to follow even that, the laziest of all occupations.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a few more questions Clarence learned so
much of Godfrey&#8217;s history, and of his disposition and
habits, that he began to think that he was already
well acquainted with him; and besides Don described
him so accurately that he could not fail to recognise
him if he once met him. This much had been gained,
and now Clarence would have given something if he
could have learned more about the property belonging
to the family that was buried during the war; but,
after thinking a moment, he decided that it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
be better for him to say nothing at all on this point.
He did not want to arouse anybody&#8217;s suspicions, and
besides, Godfrey Evans, when he found him, could
tell all he desired to know. He wanted to go to bed
now to think over the good fortune that seemed almost
within his grasp, so he began to yawn as if he were
very sleepy (if his country cousins had been guilty
of such an act he would have pronounced them boors
at once), and Don and Bert, taking the hint, said
good-night and left the room.</p>

<p>The night was as long and dreary to Clarence as
the day had been, but for a different reason. He
was impatient to be up and doing, and it seemed to
him that the morning would never come. He heard
the little clock on the mantel strike every hour from
ten to five, and then he jumped up because he could
stay in bed no longer. He was not called to breakfast
at six o&#8217;clock, as Marshall had predicted, but the
meal was ready at seven, and after they had sat down
to it Clarence, to his great disgust, found that Don
and Bert had been laying out some very elaborate
plans for the entertainment of himself and brother.
In the first place it was their intention to spend two
or three days in riding about the country, in order
to give their city relatives some idea of the manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
in which the people in the South lived, and also to
make them acquainted with all the young people in
the neighborhood who were worth knowing. Then,
of course the boys would call on them, and by the
time their visits had been returned, they might begin
to look for brant. When they began to come down
from the North, the shooting season was close at
hand; and if Clarence and Marshall liked to hunt,
they would get a party of good fellows together, and
go down to the shooting-box and spend a week there.
When they were tired of that, they would go &#8217;coon-hunting;
and when they had seen all the sport they
cared to see in that way, they would trap and shoot
some turkeys, or drive the ridges for deer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; thought Clarence, while he listened, &#8220;it
is all very fine, no doubt; but if you think you are
going to use up my time in that way, you have reckoned
without your host. Amusement indeed! What
pleasure would I see in riding about the country
calling on these natives? What do I care for your
deer or turkeys or your shooting-box? I can&#8217;t go,
at least not to-day, for I have business of my own to
attend to.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he didn&#8217;t go either; and, what was more, he
gave such reasons for declining that his cousins,
although somewhat surprised, readily let him off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
He was much too homesick to be any company during
a ride, he said, and all he wanted was to go off
somewhere and be alone. He would be himself in a
day or two, and when he felt more like mingling
with people, he would be quite at the service of his
cousins, Don and Bert. The latter expressed their
regrets, but readily accepted his excuses, and Clarence,
after making some inquiries of Don, calculated to
draw out information on a few points on which he
wished to be posted, went up to his room to prepare
himself for his interview with Godfrey Evans. When
he came down again he wore a neat hunting-suit,
and carried a light Ballard rifle on his shoulder.
Don, who met him in the hall, opened his eyes in
surprise, and went into ecstacies over the handsome
little breech-loader which Clarence presented for his
inspection.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that you city fellows ever had an
opportunity to use such things as this,&#8221; said Don,
bringing the weapon to his shoulder, and glancing
along the clean, brown barrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, yes, we do,&#8221; said Clarence. &#8220;Rifle-shooting
is becoming quite fashionable now-a-days, and I used
to spend an hour or two every evening at the gallery.
I can make forty-five out of a possible fifty almost
any time.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>This was Greek to Don, who, however, did not
ask any questions, for Clarence had so pompous a
way of giving information and looked so surprised
when any one asked him to explain his meaning, that
Don did not like to show his ignorance. He handed
the rifle back to his cousin and saw him walk out of
the house, pass through the gate, and turn down the
road that led to Godfrey Evans&#8217;s cabin.</p>

<p>We have already told what sort of a reception he
met at Godfrey&#8217;s hands, and have also described what
he did to bring himself to the notice of that gentleman.
He knew Godfrey as soon as he put his eyes
on him. He studied the man&#8217;s face closely, and
being satisfied with the opinion he formed, easily
induced him to accompany him into the woods. He
wanted to talk freely with him without running any
risk of being overheard, but he hardly knew how to
begin the conversation. He wanted to make a friend
of his new acquaintance and gain his confidence, and
in order to do that, he must be careful how he went
to work. The pipe Godfrey had lost the night
before, and which Clarence had brought with him in
his game-bag, served him a good turn. In attempting
to produce the cigars, he accidentally pulled out the
pipe also. Godfrey recognised it, and so amazed
was he to see his property, which he imagined he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
had lost beyond recovery, in the possession of an
entire stranger, that he betrayed himself at once.
After that it was no trouble for Clarence to open
conversation with him about the buried treasure, and
neither did he experience any difficulty in persuading
Godfrey to accept him as an assistant in the place
of Dan. Clarence learned to his great surprise and
amusement that he had been the innocent cause of
Godfrey&#8217;s hasty stampede on the previous night, and
it was all he could do to refrain from laughing outright
at the man&#8217;s description of the &#8220;haunt&#8221; he
had seen. We have also told what arrangements the
worthy pair made in regard to prosecuting the search
and dividing the spoils after the barrel was found,
and we know that when the interview was ended
Clarence went home happy in the belief that he would
soon be a rich man, and that no one under his uncle&#8217;s
roof, not even his brother Marshall, would be the
wiser for it. No one was the wiser for it then, but
there was one who found out all about it a few hours
later, and who interfered with his project in a manner
so unexpected and effectual, that he not only put a
stop to all efforts to find the money, but also came
very near driving all the negroes off the plantation,
and causing General Gordon the greatest trouble and
inconvenience.</p>

<small>DON&#8217;S EXPERIMENT.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Clarence reached home after his interview
with Godfrey Evans, he found the house
deserted by all the family save his aunt Mary. His
brother, his uncle and all his cousins had gone off in
the carriage to spend the day in riding about the
country, and Clarence was left to amuse himself in
any way he thought proper. He knew the time
would not hang heavily on his hands, for he had
much to think about. He wanted to make up his
mind just what he would do when he came into possession
of his share of the eighty thousand dollars.
The thought that possibly he might never get a cent
of it&mdash;that perhaps there was no barrel hidden in
the potato-patch&mdash;did not once enter his head. The
hope that it might be there, and that he might be
fortunate enough to find it, was so strong that it
became belief, and Clarence already considered himself
as good as rich.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>Under pretence of writing a letter to his mother
to tell her of his safe arrival at the plantation, he
went up stairs, where he passed the rest of the afternoon.
He made a very hasty toilet, spent about five
minutes in writing the letter&mdash;he did not ask his
mother for money&mdash;as he had expected to do&mdash;and
then gave himself up to his meditations. He was
sorry when his brother and the rest came back from
their ride, for after that he could no longer make a
hermit of himself. He was obliged to go down and
mingle with the family, which he did with a very bad
grace.</p>

<p>While they were at the supper-table something
was said about the letter he had written, and Don
volunteered to take it to the office that very night,
so that it might go out with the first mail that left
the landing, and requested Clarence to accompany
him on horseback&mdash;an invitation which the latter,
owing to his agreement with Godfrey Evans, was
obliged to decline. So Don said he would go alone,
and promised to be back shortly after dark, and in
time to practise some duets with Clarence on the
flute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Duets!&#8221; thought Clarence, in great disgust.
&#8220;Some people have queer ideas of enjoyment. Music<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
is getting to be the biggest bore in the world to me
since I came here, and I wish I had never learned it.
If anybody will give me two cents, I&#8217;ll take that
flute of mine and smash it over a chair. It cost me
thirty-five dollars, too. I can spend my time to-night
much more profitably than in practising duets. What
if we should happen to alight on the barrel the very
first time trying? Whew! It is too exciting to
think about!&#8221;</p>

<p>Don rode down to the landing and back alone,
reaching the barn about half an hour after dark.
Finding that the hostler was not there to take care
of his pony, he attended to the animal himself, working
in the dark, as there was no lantern nearer than
the house, and he did not want to take time to go
after it. He hung up his saddle and bridle, and was
about to close the barn-doors, when he happened to
look toward the house and saw a figure darting along
the carriage-way, making use of every tree and clump
of bushes to conceal his movements, and stopping
now and then to look about, as if he were afraid of
being seen by somebody. Don took just one glance
at him, and then drawing back behind the door, laid
hold of a pitchfork that was always kept standing in
the corner. Thieves visited the plantation now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
then after dark, and Don thought he had discovered
one of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;That fellow is up to something,&#8221; said he, as he
tightened his grasp on the pitchfork, &#8220;and if I keep
an eye on him, perhaps I shall find out where our
chickens and hams go so mysteriously. It must be
some one who is acquainted with the dogs, or they
would have raised a fuss before this time. Let him
pick up something, if he dares, and we&#8217;ll see how
quickly he will drop it, when he finds the tines of
this pitchfork within an inch of his nose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fairly trembling with excitement Don took off his
hat, peeped cautiously around the edge of the door,
and watched the motions of the supposed thief. The
latter did not pick up anything, however, as Don
hoped he would, but took his stand at the corner of
the barn, almost within reach of the boy&#8217;s hand, and
leaning against the building, looked down the road
as if he were waiting for somebody. Then Don saw,
to his great surprise, that it was his cousin Clarence.
He was about to step out and speak to him, when he
noticed that Clarence held a lighted cigar in his
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I had better stay where I am,&#8221; thought
Don. &#8220;If I go out there, he&#8217;ll think I have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
watching him and playing the part of a spy; and
then if father or mother should happen to say anything
to him about his smoking, he would accuse me
of telling it. I wish he would go somewhere else
and enjoy his cigar, and let me go into the house!&#8221;</p>

<p>While Don was soliloquising in this way, Clarence
suddenly darted off as if he had just thought of something,
and making his way to one of the evergreens
in the yard, drew from beneath its low, spreading
branches a couple of shovels, with which he again
approached the barn. Don looked on in great wonder,
and, forgetting the resolution he had just formed,
was about to reveal himself to his cousin, when the
creaking of the gate announced a new arrival. It
proved to be Godfrey Evans, who was at once taken
to task by Clarence for his long delay. To Don&#8217;s
amazement the two seemed as familiar as though they
had long been acquainted. The question, Where had
Clarence met Godfrey before, and what in the world
could he have to do with that worthless man? was
hardly formed in Don&#8217;s mind before it was answered,
not fully, of course, but still in a way to increase his
surprise a thousandfold, and to give him, besides, a
pretty good idea of the situation. He overheard every
word of the conversation that took place between them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
and found that they had met there by appointment;
that it was their purpose to dig up a barrel of gold
and silver that was supposed to be buried in the
potato-patch; and that Godfrey was very much afraid
to undertake the task, for fear that old Jordan&#8217;s
ghost might appear and frighten him away. Don
also inferred, from something Godfrey said, that he
had already seen the ghost once, and that a second
view would be altogether too much for him. After
spending five minutes in discussing the matter, Clarence
succeeded in infusing a little courage into Godfrey,
who accepted one of the shovels and led the
way towards the potato-patch.</p>

<p>When the two had disappeared in the darkness,
Don set the pitchfork back in its place, and drew a
long breath&mdash;the first full inspiration he had taken
for the last ten minutes. He had been so close to
the conspirators all the time that he hardly dared to
move a finger, for fear that he should attract their
attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I wonder if anybody ever heard of such a
thing as this before!&#8221; said he, drawing his handkerchief
across his forehead. &#8220;If I didn&#8217;t have the
evidence of my own eyes and ears, I shouldn&#8217;t believe
it. Who told them about the barrel, I wonder!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
I&#8217;ve heard mother say that old Jordan buried a lot of
silver-ware, such as knives, forks and spoons, for her
during the war, but I thought she had got the most
of it back again. I never heard her say she lost a
whole barrelful, and I don&#8217;t believe she did. The
only money that was ever buried on this plantation,
was fifteen hundred dollars in gold, and that was
hidden under the front steps of the old house. I&#8217;ve
seen the place a hundred times. But eighty thousand
dollars! My stars! I don&#8217;t believe father ever had
so much money at one time in his life. But suppose
it was there, and Clarence should find it; it isn&#8217;t
possible that he would be dishonest enough to keep
it. I shouldn&#8217;t like to think that my own cousin
was so great a rascal. Hold on! I&#8217;ve just thought
of a trick that will beat the hollow pumpkin all to
pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>Talking thus to himself, Don carefully closed and
locked the stable-door, and with noiseless footsteps
stole along the fence until he arrived opposite the
place where Clarence and Godfrey were at work in
the field. He could see them plainly, for they were
but a few yards from the fence, and as he watched
them it was all he could do to keep from giving a
few dismal groans, just to see what effect the sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
would have upon them. The only thing that restrained
him was the fear that by so doing he would
interfere with the plans he had suddenly formed,
and which he intended to put into operation the very
next day. He did not want to frighten Godfrey
away from the potato-patch just then. He wanted
him to come again the next night, and by that time
he would be ready to show him something. He
stayed in the fence-corner for half an hour; and then
knowing that if he remained there any longer, his
absence would be certain to attract the attention of
the family, and perhaps lead to more questions from
his father and mother than he would care to answer,
he arose and stole away toward the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen anything of Clarence?&#8221; was the
first question his cousin Marshall asked him, after he
had distributed the mail he brought from the post-office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw him. He&#8217;s out there,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out there!&#8221; replied the general. &#8220;Out where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out near the barn when I first saw him,&#8221; said
Don; and to himself he added: &#8220;I suppose I ought
to tell now where he was the last time I saw him,
but that would never do. I don&#8217;t want to get my
cousin into trouble, and neither do I want to spoil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
all my fun. Won&#8217;t I have things fixed for Godfrey
to-morrow night, though? I&#8217;ll scare him so that he
will never put his foot on the plantation again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder that the time hangs heavily on
his hands,&#8221; continued the general. &#8220;Our quiet
country life probably has no charms for him, and he
is lonely and homesick.&#8221;</p>

<p>This seemed to be the verdict of all the members
of the family, who, being willing to make due allowances
and give their city relative all the privileges
he demanded, said no more about his absence. They
welcomed him very cordially when he came in, two
hours later, but asked him no questions. Indeed,
Clarence did not wait to be questioned. He went to
bed almost immediately, and Don soon followed him.</p>

<p>The next day the general went off somewhere on
business, and the boys were left to amuse themselves
in any way they pleased. Bert and Marshall got
into one of the canoes and set off to visit the shooting-box.
They asked Don and Clarence to go with
them; but the latter could not see that there was any
fun in riding a mile or two in a leaky dug-out for the
purpose of looking at an old shantee in the woods,
and Don had other business on hand, so neither of
them accepted the invitation. Clarence found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
most pleasure in getting away by himself and thinking
about the fortune of which he expected very soon
to be the master, while Don wanted to spend at
least a portion of the forenoon in getting ready to
receive Godfrey Evans when he came to the potato-patch
that night; and as they both desired to be
alone, they did not in any way interfere with each
other.</p>

<p>As soon as Clarence could find an excuse for so
doing, he went up stairs to his room; and Don,
being left to himself, managed to secure a rusty key
which hung on a nail in the kitchen, and to effect an
entrance into a long-unused room in the rear of the
barn; and he performed both these necessary operations
without attracting the attention of any one.</p>

<p>As soon as he had locked the door behind him
Don breathed easier, and stopped to look about him.
The room had once belonged to old Jordan, the runaway
negro, who had served as the general&#8217;s hostler
in the days gone by. Being a very faithful and a
favorite servant, he had received many favors, and
was also allowed the privilege of a room to himself.
The apartment looked just as it did on the day the
sable occupant deserted it. Not a thing had been
disturbed, and Don was the only one who had entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
the room since the morning following the day on
which the levee was cut. When Mrs. Gordon became
satisfied that old Jordan had run away, she gave
instructions that the room should be closed and
locked and the window nailed down, so that nobody
could enter it. Jordan would be sure to come back
some day, she said, and when he did, he would find
his property secure, and his room waiting for him.
But the years had gone by, the old fellow had never
been heard from, and everybody began to think he
was dead.</p>

<p>The first thing Don did, after locking the door
behind him, was to take from his pocket a small bundle,
which being undone proved to contain a brush
and a box of blacking. His next move was to open
a huge chest that stood at the head of the bed. In
it he found four articles he needed&mdash;a suit of clothes
neatly folded up; a gaudily-colored handkerchief;
a shining plug hat, that had once been the property of
the general; and a pair of heavy plantation shoes,
like those which used to be so extensively manufactured
in New England under the name of &#8220;russets.&#8221;
The fifth article Don needed to complete the disguise
he was about to assume was a walking-stick, and
that stood in the corner behind the chest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>Having selected everything he wanted, Don
quickly divested himself of his outer clothing, and in
two minutes more had put on old Jordan&#8217;s Sunday
suit, which fitted him well enough for all practical
purposes. The shoes were much too large, but by
putting a roll of paper in the toe of each, he found
that he could walk in them very well. He wrapped
the handkerchief about his head, leaving the ends
hanging down behind, and taking care to cover up
all his hair so that no one could see it, and placed
the plug hat on the top of it. Then the blacking
brush, and the three-cornered piece of looking glass
that was nailed against the wall, came into use, and
in a few minutes more Don had made such a change
in his appearance that his own father would not have
recognised him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I had some of that burnt cork, or whatever
it is, that the minstrels use to blacken their
faces,&#8221; said the boy, glancing into the little mirror
after he had finished his work. &#8220;My white skin
shows through almost too much. But, after all, who
cares for that? It will be dark when I present
myself to Godfrey, and I shall have no need to be so
very particular about my hands and face. I say!
this is going to a good deal of trouble for a little fun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
isn&#8217;t it? No matter; if I can see Godfrey run as
he did on the night he saw the pumpkin with the
lighted candle in it, I shall be well repaid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don could remember old Jordan very well, for,
although he was young when the latter went away,
his peculiar actions and odd style of dress had made
a lasting impression on him. Besides, he had heard
him described time and again; and his sayings had
been so often repeated, and his style of locomotion so
frequently imitated by those who knew him, that
Don thought he should have no difficulty in passing
himself off for old Jordan. Now that he was dressed
and ready for the performance, he thought it would
be a great pity to assume his own character again
before he had tested his disguise.</p>

<p>This thought had no sooner suggested itself to him
than he prepared to act upon it. Everything favored
him. The door of the room, opening as it did into
a narrow passage-way that led from the barn into
the corn-crib, was out of sight of anybody who might
happen to be on the barn floor. The only difficult
thing for him to do, was to get out of the passage-way
without being seen. That being accomplished he did
not care who saw him&mdash;provided, of course, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
members of the family kept out of the way&mdash;for no
one could tell where he came from.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must first make sure of a way of retreat,&#8221;
thought Don, as he looked about the room for something
with which to draw the nails that held the
window. &#8220;I must get back into this room, somehow,
and it may not be quite safe to get back the same
way I go out.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Don could not find a hammer or anything else
to draw the nails with, so he broke them off by prying
them up and down with the end of his walking-stick.
Then he raised the window, placing a stick
under it to keep it open, and unhooked the shutter
which fitted tightly enough to remain closed, even
when it was not fastened. After that he looked into
the mirror again, touched up one or two white spots
on his hands and face, grasped his walking-stick,
and slipped out into the passage-way. Locking the
door he put the key into his pocket, and moved cautiously
down the passage-way until he could look
into the barn.</p>

<p>There was no one there except the hostler, and he
was busy and his back was turned toward Don.
Moving with noiseless footsteps, the boy succeeded
in walking out into the middle of the floor before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
was discovered. He did not expect to be recognised
by the hostler, for the latter was a new hand who
had never been acquainted with Jordan; but there
were some negroes at work in the field close by who
knew the old fellow he was now personating, and
toward them Don directed his course.</p>

<p>The hostler looked up from his work when he
heard the sound of footsteps behind him, and seeing
a strange negro approaching, spoke to him very civilly;
but Don took no notice of him. He was playing
ghost now, and ghosts did not speak to anybody&mdash;at
least he had never heard that they did. Walking
straight out of the door he turned toward the place
where the negroes were at work, and had not made
many steps before one of them discovered him. He
straightened up quickly, shaded his eyes with his
hand, and said a few words in a low tone to his
companions, who also turned and looked at Don.
They gazed fixedly at him for a moment, and then
broke out into a chorus of greeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bress my soul an&#8217; body, if dar ain&#8217;t ole uncle
Jordan!&#8221; they exclaimed in concert.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; thought Don. &#8220;If they can&#8217;t
recognise me in the daytime, I am sure Godfrey
Evans will not know me in the dark. I believe if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
I should go into the house I could fool everybody
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scarcely able to control himself, so great was his
desire to laugh, Don kept straight on toward the
negroes, who had dropped their hoes and were hurrying
up to shake hands with him. His silence seemed
to surprise them greatly. They stopped short, looked
curiously at him first, then suspiciously, and after
exchanging a few words that Don could not hear,
began backing out of his way.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t ole Jordan, nudder,&#8221; suddenly exclaimed
one of the negroes.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, hush yer noise, boy,&#8221; said another. &#8220;Don&#8217;t I
know dot ole white coat, an&#8217; dot plug hat dot ole
marse guv him on dot Christmas day, jest &#8217;fore he
went away to de wah? Yes, I does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No odds,&#8221; replied the one who had first spoken.
&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t ole Jordan. He&#8217;s dead, an&#8217; dis is his haunt.&#8221;
These words were all that were needed to frighten
the superstitious field-hands almost out of their senses.
They did not go into a panic and run, as Don hoped
they would, but retreated out of his way and watched
him from a distance, looking at one another now and
then, and shaking their heads and acting altogether
as if they were at their wits&#8217; end. Don took a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
turn about the field&mdash;he did not dare to stay out
there very long for fear of being seen by somebody
in the house&mdash;and then turned toward the barn again.</p>

<p>As soon as the corn-crib hid him from the gaze of
the negroes, he straightened up and ran swiftly to the
window that opened into old Jordan&#8217;s room. Throwing
back the shutter he scrambled through as quickly
as he could, and shutting himself in, laid down on
old Jordan&#8217;s bed and shook all over with suppressed
laughter. He heard the footsteps and the voices of
the negroes as they passed around the barn, looking
for him; and the few words of their conversation
which he overheard satisfied him that his experiment
had been a decided success. He must have
imitated old Jordan perfectly to be taken for him in
broad daylight.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small>A JOKE THAT WAS NO JOKE.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WE have already described the other tests to
which Don put his disguise during the forenoon,
and we know that every one who saw him
believed him to be old Jordan&#8217;s ghost. Godfrey,
especially, was greatly alarmed, and Don had the
satisfaction of seeing him run, which was a sight
worth going miles to behold. The magical manner
in which he appeared and vanished, was very bewildering
to all who witnessed it; but it would have
been no mystery at all, had they been aware that the
window that led into old Jordan&#8217;s room was unfastened.
As they could see nothing of Don after
he went behind the corn-crib, they naturally concluded
that he had vanished into thin air. In no other way
could they account for his disappearance.</p>

<p>Don had wasted a good deal of time in these experiments,
and now the ringing of the dinner-bell
admonished him that he must pull off his disguise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
and hurry back to the house. Another thing that
warned him to make haste, was the knowledge that
he had thrown the negroes into a state of great excitement
and alarm. He was afraid they might tell
his parents what they had seen, and that would bring
about an investigation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would never do to be caught in the act,&#8221;
thought Don, as he hastily pulled off old Jordan&#8217;s
clothes and bundled them into the chest. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know what father would say to me. But didn&#8217;t
Godfrey run, though? I declare it seems selfish for
me to enjoy all this fun by myself. I wish I had
some good fellow to help me laugh!&#8221;</p>

<p>Don stopped for a few minutes to indulge in a very
hearty but silent fit of merriment, and then having
put on his clothes, and wiped the black off his hands
and face with a damp cloth which he had taken the
precaution to bring with him, he glanced about the
room to make sure that he had left everything just
as he had found it, and went out, locking the door
behind him. He reached the house and made his
way to his room without being seen, and having performed
a hasty toilet, went down to the dining-room
in time to learn that the measures he had taken to
frighten Godfrey Evans, had succeeded almost too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
well. One of the servant girls was standing at the
door showing a good deal of the whites of her eyes,
and looking altogether as if she were highly excited
about something.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all nonsense, Jane,&#8221; Don heard his mother
say.</p>

<p>&#8220;No odds, missus,&#8221; replied the girl. &#8220;Sam say
he can&#8217;t hitch up dem hosses no mo&#8217;. He wouldn&#8217;t
go nigh dat barn, he say, fur no money in dis broad
world. He done seed it, suah.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don, well knowing what it was that the girl referred
to, and hardly able to control himself, so great
was his desire to laugh, glanced about the table to
see what the family thought about it. They were
all there, and their faces expressed the greatest
astonishment. Even the general elevated his eye-brows,
and turned about in his chair to look at the
girl. Don sat down in his place and tried to look as
surprised as the rest did; and then recollecting that
he had yet seen or heard nothing to be surprised at,
he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, mother just sent out word to Sam to hitch
up the horses,&#8221; said Bert, &#8220;and he sent back word
that he couldn&#8217;t think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; inquired Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, because he&#8217;s got it into his head that there&#8217;s
something out there&mdash;something that looks like old
Jordan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, Jane. I will look into the matter
after dinner,&#8221; said the general.</p>

<p>The girl disappeared, and the family being left
alone, devoted themselves to the viands before them
and to discussing the strange incidents that were
reported to have happened at the barn during the
forenoon. Don found that, for a wonder, the story
of his exploits had been told without the exaggeration
common in such cases, but, to keep up appearances,
he was obliged to feign ignorance, and inquire particularly
into things. Bert and his mother declared
that it was all moonshine&mdash;that the hostler had not
seen anything; but the general was pretty well convinced
that something had happened, and that an
investigation would not be out of place. It was a
wonder that no one suspected Don, and perhaps the
reason was because he looked so innocent.</p>

<p>The investigation came off immediately after dinner,
but nothing new was brought to light. The
hostler told his story in a straightforward manner
and produced his witnesses to prove what he said;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
and so positive were they all that they had seen Jordan&#8217;s
haunt about the barn but a few hours before,
that the general began to think that perhaps the old
fellow had returned after his long absence, but, for
some reason which he could not explain, was keeping
himself as close as possible. The general tried to
laugh the matter off at first, but soon found that it
was much too serious for that; and his face assumed
an expression of trouble and anxiety when he found
that the field hands, one and all, had sent him word
by the hostler that when night came, they would
call on him for the money that was due them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am really afraid I have made a mess of it,&#8221;
thought Don, when he heard this. &#8220;I had no idea
that I was going to scare everybody so badly, and I
wish now I hadn&#8217;t done it. No matter, it will soon
be over now. I&#8217;ll frighten Godfrey to-night, if he
comes after that barrel, and then I&#8217;ll never play old
Jordan again!&#8221;</p>

<p>The general looked grave and seemed greatly
perplexed, and so did Mrs. Gordon; while the boys,
Don among the rest, declared that there must be
some explanation for the strange things that had
happened in the barn that morning, and spent the
rest of the day in trying to clear away the mystery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
They looked in every place, except the one in which
they would have been the most likely to find some
clue to aid them in their search, and hunted for everything
except the right one. They all believed now&mdash;all
except Don, of course&mdash;that old Jordan had
come back, and they looked everywhere for him,
except in his room. They knew he could not have
gone in there if he had been so disposed, for the door
was locked.</p>

<p>Night came at last, and so did all the negroes
employed on the plantation, who asked for their
money. The general, knowing that it would be of
no use to argue with them, declined to pay them off
until the year for which they were hired was ended;
but he promised that, if they saw the apparition again
and would show it to him, he would settle with them
at once and let them all go. Don breathed easier
after that. He was afraid that his propensity for
mischief was about to occasion his father great inconvenience,
and he was glad that the trouble could be
averted without a confession on his part. He told
himself that his father would never see the apparition.
He would take precious good care to avoid that.</p>

<p>Don did not put on old Jordan&#8217;s clothes that night,
because Godfrey did not come to the potato-patch as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
he had agreed. Clarence waited and watched for
him until nine o&#8217;clock, and as soon as he could slip
away from his relatives the next morning, he went
down to Godfrey&#8217;s cabin to see what had kept him at
home. Don followed him at a distance, and saw that
his cousin held a long and earnest conversation with
Godfrey, and that he seemed to be very much elated
about something when he came back. By putting
these two things together, Don arrived at the conclusion
that Godfrey would be on hand that night,
and so he was. Don happened to be on the watch
when he went into the summer-house; and knowing
that Godfrey would not come so far unless he intended
to go the rest of the way, he ran back to the house
to get ready for him. It was certainly provoking,
when he was in so great a hurry, to find the kitchen
occupied by two servants, who would surely see him
if he took the key to Jordan&#8217;s room down from its
nail, and who, besides, would be certain to speak
about it. They must be got out of the room somehow,
and there was no time to waste.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane,&#8221; said Don, suddenly, &#8220;did you hear
mother calling you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sar,&#8221; replied the girl, jumping up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t either,&#8221; was Don&#8217;s mental comment, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
she hurried away. &#8220;Ben,&#8221; he added, turning to the
old negro who sat in the chimney-corner, &#8220;what did
old preacher Hudson want of you just a few minutes
ago?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sar?&#8221; exclaimed Ben. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see no preacher
Hudson to-day, sar!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, wasn&#8217;t he out at the gate just now calling
for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe so, sar,&#8221; replied Ben, rising and picking
up his hat, &#8220;but I didn&#8217;t see him. Mebbe he&#8217;s dar
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he is,&#8221; said Don, to himself, &#8220;but
it will not hurt you to go out and see; and in the
meantime&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Don put the key into his pocket as soon as Ben
was out of sight, and lost no time in making his way
to the barn. At the door he met the hostler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time to lock up now, Mr. Don,&#8221; said the latter,
&#8220;but I&#8217;se a little jubus &#8217;bout dat barn, sar. Yes,
sar, I&#8217;se a little jubus!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, go back to your quarters and I will
lock the doors,&#8221; replied Don.</p>

<p>The hostler, glad to be relieved of so disagreeable
a duty, turned and went off, and Don, after closing
all the doors, and locking all except one, hurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
into old Jordan&#8217;s room. It was the work of but a
few minutes to put on the negro&#8217;s clothes and black
his face and hands; and this being done, he seized a
shovel, and stealing out of the barn, climbed the
fence and ran across the potato-patch. About thirty
yards from the fence he stopped, and crouching down
close to the ground, waited to see what was going to
happen. Presently he heard cautious footsteps, and
a few seconds later two heads appeared above the top
rail of the fence.</p>

<p>&#8220;There they are,&#8221; thought Don, his heart beating
rapidly with excitement. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ll see if either
of them has courage enough to come over the fence
after they find out I am here.&#8221;</p>

<p>As these thoughts passed through Don&#8217;s mind he
arose to his feet, and driving his shovel into the
ground began throwing out the dirt so rapidly, that
in a very short space of time he had dug a hole as
large as a moderate workman would have been able
to dig in ten minutes. He worked till the perspiration
started out all over him, but kept his eyes fastened
on the two heads, which could be seen plainly
above the fence. He knew that the owners of the
heads heard the sound of the shovel, and that they
were listening to it and talking about it. They stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
there at the fence so long that Don began to think
they were too badly frightened to come any nearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I haven&#8217;t managed this thing quite
right,&#8221; thought Don. &#8220;I ought to have let them
come into the field first, and then showed myself to
them while they were at work. Godfrey will never
come within reach of me again while I have these
clothes on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Very likely Godfrey never would, if he had been
left to himself; but Don had somebody else to contend
with, and that was his cousin Clarence, upon
whom he had thus far scarcely bestowed a thought.
Clarence had more courage then Godfrey. He had
almost too much, Don afterward thought, when he
found himself tied up in the potato-hole.</p>

<p>The two stood at the fence and talked and listened
for a few minutes, and then to Don&#8217;s great surprise,
and somewhat to his alarm, they jumped over into
the field and came toward him, Clarence leading the
way.</p>

<p>Don had half a mind to throw down his shovel
and take to his heels; but suppose he had done so,
and the swift-footed Godfrey, emboldened by his
flight, had followed and caught him! What then?
It would have turned the joke upon himself, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
besides Clarence would have found that his cousin
was acquainted with his secret, and that was something
Don did not want him to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am between two fires,&#8221; thought Don, almost
ready to laugh in spite of his fear of detection, &#8220;and
for once in my life I have overreached myself. I
am sure to be found out, no matter whether I run
away or stay here, and then what will Clarence think
of himself? Could he ever face father again, after
entering into a conspiracy to rob him of eighty
thousand dollars? I&#8217;d like to spare his feelings if I
can. Perhaps if I keep on digging, and act as though
I didn&#8217;t see or hear them, they will become frightened
and go away.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was Don&#8217;s only hope now, but it did not last
long, for it was hardly formed in his mind before
Clarence marched up and seized him by the arm.
Don was highly amused by the conversation the two
engaged in when they came close to him; and when
Clarence lighted a match and surveyed him by the
light it threw out, he would have spoken, had his
cousin made the least sign of recognition. But
Clarence could see no resemblance between those
black features and Don&#8217;s handsome face; and besides
Godfrey was so positive that they had captured old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
Jordan himself, that he never had a suspicion of the
truth.</p>

<p>Don played the part of ghost as long as he could,
and spoke only when he found that he must, or feel
the weight of Godfrey&#8217;s shovel in his ribs. As he
could see no way out of the difficulty in which he was
placed, he trusted entirely to luck, hoping that Clarence
would let him go without compelling him to tell
who he was. He heard all that passed between the
two, and was not a little amazed to learn that he was
to be confined in the potato-hole, and left without
anything to eat or drink, until he was ready to tell
where the barrel was hidden. He pondered the matter
deeply while he was being led across the field and
down the road toward Godfrey&#8217;s cabin, but did not
reveal himself, because he still clung to the hope
that something might turn up in his favor. He
uttered a feeble protest against the treatment he was
receiving, just as he believed old Jordan would have
done, had he been in the same situation, but of course
it did no good. While Godfrey was gone for the rope
and he was alone with Clarence, he was several times
on the point of speaking out, but could not without
doing the very thing he most wished to avoid.
While he was thinking about it, Godfrey came back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
and almost before he knew it, he was confined in the
cellar, and Clarence and Godfrey were out of hearing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here I am,&#8221; thought Don, &#8220;and if I don&#8217;t get
out and reach home very shortly after Clarence does
there will be a hubbub indeed. I wish I hadn&#8217;t done
it. What a desperate fellow that Clarence Gordon
is! If he doesn&#8217;t turn over a new leaf pretty soon,
he will come to some bad end as sure as he is a living
boy. What will he have to say for himself when he
finds out what he has done? O, I must get away!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Don&#8217;s resolutions amounted to nothing, and
neither did the efforts he made to free himself from
his bonds. Godfrey had done his work well, and
Don could move neither hand nor foot. He tried to
pull the stanchion down, but it was as solid as it was
the first day it was put up there, and Don could not
even shake it. He was fast, and there he must stay
until some one came to release him. His feelings,
as he began to realize this fact, were none of the
pleasantest, but still they were much more agreeable
than his cousin&#8217;s were the next morning, when he
first learned from Godfrey Evans who it was that he
had assisted to capture and imprison the night before;
and to him we will now turn before we tell how Don
got out, and what happened to him afterward.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>We left Clarence leaning against the corn-crib,
almost overwhelmed with the startling disclosures his
companion in trouble had just made to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see through some of it now jest as easy as
fallin&#8217; off a log,&#8221; moaned Godfrey, rocking himself
back and forth as he sat on the ground, &#8220;an&#8217; I blame
myself fur not seein&#8217; through it sooner. That thar
Don is a great feller fur tricks, an&#8217; here he&#8217;s gone
an&#8217; dressed hisself up like ole Jordan so&#8217;s to fool me
an&#8217; the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is the case,&#8221; said Clarence, who at last
succeeded in finding his tongue, &#8220;he must have
known about the barrel; and how did he find that
out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say I could see through it all, did I?&#8221;
demanded Godfrey. &#8220;That&#8217;s the part I can&#8217;t understand,
no more&#8217;n I can understand how you fust come
to know about the bar&#8217;l.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know it was Don?&#8221; asked Clarence,
who could not realize the situation in which he was
placed. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t been near the cellar this
morning, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I hain&#8217;t; but I know it&#8217;s Mr. Don all the
same,&#8221; replied Godfrey. &#8220;Did ye never hear him
whistle? Wal, I have. He can whistle so&#8217;t ye can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
hear him a mile; an&#8217; the fust thing I heerd this
mornin&#8217;, when I opened my eyes, was him a whistlin&#8217;
like he was a callin&#8217; his dogs. I went to the door
an&#8217; listened, kase somethin&#8217; kinder told me that
mebbe things wasn&#8217;t jest right like they&#8217;d oughter
be, an&#8217; if them whistles didn&#8217;t come from that tater-hole,
I ain&#8217;t a settin&#8217; here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t old Jordan whistle?&#8221; asked Clarence,
who still clung to the hope that Godfrey was mistaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not like that, an&#8217; nuther could anybody else.
I tell you he&#8217;s thar, Mr. Clarence, an&#8217; now what&#8217;s
goin&#8217; to become of me an&#8217; you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;De pony ready, sar,&#8221; said the hostler, showing
himself at the end of the crib at this moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whar ye goin&#8217;?&#8221; asked Godfrey, as Clarence
moved away. &#8220;Don&#8217;t leave me now. I&#8217;m in a
power of trouble an&#8217; trib&#8217;lation!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I any better off, I&#8217;d like to know?&#8221; demanded
the boy angrily. &#8220;You think of no one but yourself.
Here am I, fifteen hundred miles from home,
and with scarcely twenty dollars that I can call my
own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s more&#8217;n I&#8217;ve got,&#8221; whined Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t care a snap if we had only found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
barrel,&#8221; continued Clarence. &#8220;With my pockets
full of money I could go anywhere; but as it is, how
am I going to get home? That&#8217;s what troubles me.
Of course I can&#8217;t stay here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more can I,&#8221; said Godfrey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you can. No one will ever say a word to
you about it; but I can&#8217;t face any of my uncle&#8217;s
family after what I have done. Of course Don will
blow the whole thing the minute he gets out. He
can&#8217;t avoid it, unless he tells a lie, and that&#8217;s something
he says he never did in his life. I wish to
goodness I could say as much!&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence had, beyond a doubt, placed himself in a
very unpleasant situation, and the longer he talked
and thought about it, the more vividly did the fact
seem to impress itself upon his mind. One thing
was certain: he could not stay under his uncle&#8217;s roof
any longer, and he thought it would be policy to get
as far as possible out of the way before the general
returned. He ran around the corner of the crib to
the place where the pony was standing, and paying
no heed to Godfrey&#8217;s earnest entreaties that he would
stay just long enough to tell him what he ought to
do under the circumstances, Clarence sprang into the
saddle and galloped out of the yard. Almost involuntarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
he turned down the road toward Godfrey&#8217;s
cabin. He had a vague idea that something might
yet be done to avert the calamity he so much dreaded.
If Don would promise to say nothing about what had
happened the night before, and make up some plausible
story to tell his father, he (Clarence) would
release him, and read him a lecture on the subject
of practical joking. That much being arranged, he
could, perhaps, content himself on the plantation for
two weeks longer, during which time he could write
to his mother, who would be sure to send him money
to take him home, if he asked for it. As soon as it
arrived he would bid good-by to all his relatives in
Mississippi; and when he was once safely on board
a steamer bound up the river, he did not care how
soon Don told about passing the night in the potato-hole.
The longer Clarence thought of this, the more
feasible did the plan seem. It all rested with Don,
and he was a good-hearted fellow, who, for the sake
of keeping his cousin out of trouble, ought to be
willing to tell a lie. Clarence thought it would do
do harm to ask him, at any rate; and with this
object in view he put the pony into a gallop, and
went down the lane at a more rapid rate than he had
ever before travelled on horseback.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>Arriving at the turn in the road, where he had
remained to keep guard over the prisoner while Godfrey
was gone after the rope, Clarence dismounted,
tied the pony to a swinging branch, climbed the fence
and made his way through the brier-patch toward
the potato-hole. He listened repeatedly, but could
not hear Don&#8217;s whistle, and he hoped that it was
because his cousin was tired and had stopped to rest;
but something told him that it was because he had
been liberated. This proved to be the truth of the
matter, as Clarence found when he reached the cellar.
The door stood wide open, and looking in he saw the
plough-line with which his cousin had been bound,
lying in pieces at the foot of the stanchion.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all over with me,&#8221; thought Clarence, hurrying
away from the cellar with as much haste as he
would have exhibited had he seen some frightful
object there. &#8220;Very likely he is at home by this
time telling all he knows. I wish I was at home
too. I don&#8217;t see why I ever consented to come here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence suddenly stopped and listened intently.
A few weeks ago he would not have noticed the
sound that attracted his attention, but he noticed it
now, faint as it was, and he was glad to hear it, too.
It was the sound of a steam whistle, and it came
from the river below him. He recognised it at once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
for he had heard it often during his journey down
the river. &#8220;That&#8217;s the Emma Deane,&#8221; thought he.
&#8220;She has been to New Orleans, and is now on her
way up the river. Can I reach the landing in time
to catch her, I wonder? I will, if Don&#8217;s pony has
the wind to stand the gallop.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence ran through the brier-patch, scratching
his hands and face and tearing his clothes at almost
every step, but nothing could stop his progress.
Reaching the fence where he had left the pony, he
quickly untied him, and jumping on his back, went
tearing up the road with all the speed the spirited
little animal could be induced to put forth. He did
not look up when he passed his uncle&#8217;s house, but
kept his hat down over his eyes, urged on the pony,
and finally disappeared around the bend, and entered
a thick piece of woods that bounded that side of General
Gordon&#8217;s plantation. As he dashed along wholly
engrossed with his gloomy thoughts, and intent on
reaching the landing before the steamer, there was
a violent rustling among the bushes, the pony jumped
quickly to one side, and his rider, being taken off his
guard, was thrown flat in the middle of the dusty
lane. Clarence scrambled to his feet and made a
blind dash to recover the bridle which had been
pulled from his grasp, but the pony was too quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
for him. He wheeled on the instant, flourished his
heels in the air and started for home.</p>

<p>Clarence was not injured in the least by the fall,
but he was pretty well shaken, and so nearly blinded
by the dust that it was a minute or two before he
could collect his scattered senses, and clear his eyes
so that he could take note of what was going on
around him. The first thing he saw was the pony&#8217;s
white tail disappearing around the turn in the road,
and the next was Godfrey Evans, who arose from a
thicket of bushes, and hurrying up laid hold of the
boy&#8217;s collar.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty badly shaken up, but I don&#8217;t need any
help,&#8221; said Clarence, who was already on his feet.
&#8220;Hallo! what&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence had by this time cleared the dust from
his eyes so that he could take a good look at his
companion. There was an expression on his face
that he had never seen there before, and he did not
know what to make of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you let go my collar?&#8221; demanded
Clarence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kase I want them twenty dollars ye&#8217;ve got in
yer pocket&mdash;that&#8217;s why,&#8221; replied Godfrey, savagely.</p>

<p>Clarence was too amazed to speak.</p>

<small>CONCLUSION.</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;HAND &#8217;em out here, I say,&#8221; repeated Godfrey,
&#8220;an&#8217; don&#8217;t waste no time in thinkin&#8217; about it,
nuther!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve turned highwayman, have you?&#8221; said
the boy, recovering his power of speech by an effort.
&#8220;Well, you shan&#8217;t have the money. I have use for
it myself, and I could easily use more if I had it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So can I use it,&#8221; said Godfrey, &#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;m going
to have it, too. Yer mighty good to yerself, ain&#8217;t
ye? Yer going off to yer home, fifteen hundred
miles away, an&#8217; leave me to bear the brunt of this
business as best I can. But I ain&#8217;t agoin&#8217; to stay
nuther. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; away, too. Hand &#8217;em out here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what shall I do?&#8221; asked Clarence, who
began to grow alarmed when he saw how determined
Godfrey was. &#8220;How shall I get home without any
money to pay my way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hand &#8217;em out here, I say, an&#8217; be quick about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
it,&#8221; answered Godfrey, making an effort to put his
hand into the boy&#8217;s pocket. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care how ye
get hum. Ye got me into this scrape an&#8217; ye must
pay my way outen it; that&#8217;s how the thing stands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not go home at all,&#8221; exclaimed Clarence,
doubling himself up and resisting to the utmost all
Godfrey&#8217;s efforts to force his hand into his pocket.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay and see this thing out on purpose to have
you arrested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be miles back in the swamp in less&#8217;n an
hour,&#8221; replied Godfrey, becoming enraged at the
boy&#8217;s opposition and throwing him flat on his back
in the road. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got my rifle with me, an&#8217; the
fust man that follows me will come to his death!&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence did not doubt this in the least, for the
expression on Godfrey&#8217;s face told him that he was
terribly in earnest. He was like a child in the angry
man&#8217;s grasp, but knowing how much depended on
the small stock of money he had in his pocket he
fought desperately to retain possession of it, but all
to no purpose. Godfrey rolled him over, face downward,
and holding him fast with one hand, quickly
found the pocket-book with the other and pulled it
out. He was about to examine it to make sure that
the money was in it, but just then his ear caught the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
clatter of a horse&#8217;s hoofs on the hard road. He listened
to it a moment, and then jumped up and ran
into the thicket from which he had just emerged;
while Clarence, being equally anxious to avoid observation,
scrambled to his feet with all haste and
plunged into an opposite thicket. Almost overcome
with the violence of his exertions he lay flat upon
the ground, behind a convenient log, until the horseman
came in sight, and then quickly ducked his head
and held his breath. It was his uncle. He passed
swiftly along, looking neither to the right nor left,
and disappeared around a bend in the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; panted Clarence. &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that a narrow
escape? What if I had waited to tell him about
the robbery, as I at first meant to do? This is a
little ahead of any experience I have had yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence looked up and down the road to make
sure that the coast was clear, and then came out and
crossed over to the opposite side to look for Godfrey.
He was not to be seen. Clarence listened intently,
but could hear nothing but the sighing of the wind
through the branches of the trees. He called Godfrey&#8217;s
name as loudly as he dared, but no answer
was returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone,&#8221; thought the boy, &#8220;and so are my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
twenty dollars; and here I am, two miles from the
landing, afoot and alone. I wish I dared stay and
have that fellow hunted up and punished. But I&#8217;d
much rather lose the money than face my uncle after
he finds out what I have done. I declare, I&#8217;m a nice-looking
fellow to go among folks,&#8221; he added, looking
down at his coat, which was sadly soiled and torn.
&#8220;And the worst of it is, I shall continue to look this
way for some days to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence thumped his clothes energetically to
knock the dust out of them, settled his hat firmly on
his head and set out at his best pace in the direction
of Rochdale. He ran almost all the way, and the
last half mile he made in remarkably quick time considering
the circumstances, for he heard the Emma
Deane whistle as she approached the landing. When
he turned into the street on which the post-office
stood, he was almost ready to drop with fatigue, but
he was obliged to run faster than ever, for he heard
the bell ring, and he knew that that was a signal to
the crew to stand by the lines. He hoped there
would be no one at the landing to see him, but he did
not know the habits of the planters living in the vicinity.
They were out in full force, and Clarence, as
he dashed through them with his hat in his hand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
the perspiration streaming from his face, excited no
little astonishment, as he knew by the remarks he
heard on every side. He staggered up the staging,
and unable to go a step farther, sat down on the stairs
that led to the boiler-deck, and panted loudly. The
mates of the boat and the shipping clerk thought they
recognised him, but were not quite sure about it;
and that was not to be wondered at, for he looked
very unlike the dashing, fashionably-dressed young
fellow who had spent his money so freely for ale and
cigars on the down trip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this you, Gordon?&#8221; exclaimed the clerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s what is left of me,&#8221; gasped Clarence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how did you ever get into this fix? Your
clothes are torn&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; interrupted Clarence. &#8220;Wait until I
recover my breath, and I&#8217;ll tell you all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence reached the steamer just in time; for, as
he sank panting and exhausted upon the stairs, the
lines were cast off, and in five minutes more the
Emma Deane was on her way up the river. The
clerk superintended the getting out of the freight that
was to be put off at the next landing, and then came
and sat down beside Clarence, who, by this time,
began to feel a little more like himself.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p272.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Clarence Escapes on the &#8220;Emma Deane.&#8221;</span></p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>&#8220;Am I not a pretty looking object?&#8221; said the
latter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve seen you when I thought you looked
better,&#8221; answered the clerk, with a laugh. &#8220;Been
taking a rough and tumble with somebody ashore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Clarence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You left your baggage, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have none. I am only going to Cairo on
business for my uncle. I left home on a skittish
young horse, that I was to leave at the landing until
my uncle could send for him, but he did not bring
me all the way. He threw me up there in the woods,
and dragged me about twenty yards with my foot in
the stirrup, before I could free myself. But I had
no idea I was so badly used up,&#8221; said Clarence, rising
to his feet and pulling off his coat. &#8220;If I had, I
should have gone back and made a new start with
another suit of clothes. I say, haven&#8217;t you an extra
coat to sell? The rest of my clothes will do until I
reach Cairo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I can accommodate you,&#8221; said the clerk.
&#8220;Come up to my room, and after you have taken a
wash and a brush you&#8217;ll look better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence accompanied the clerk to his room in
Texas (that is the name given to the upper cabin in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
river steamers), and after he had bathed his hands
and face, and given his clothes a thorough brushing
he proceeded to make an estimate of the damages he
had received. He decided that his trowsers, boots
and vest would pass muster, and so would his shirt
and collar, although they were both pretty badly
rumpled; but the coat was torn beyond all repair,
and was fit only for somebody&#8217;s rag-bag. The clerk
thought so too, and took down from a nail in his room
a coat which he said he didn&#8217;t need, and which
Clarence might wear and welcome if he were only
going on to Cincinnati; but as he was to stop off at
Cairo, perhaps he had better buy it. Clarence
thought now that he would have played his game a
little sharper if he had said nothing about stopping
at Cairo; but, in order to make the story he had yet
to tell appear reasonable, he was obliged to hold to
what he had already said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately I am not going to Cincinnati,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;My business will take me no farther than
Cairo. What&#8217;s the coat worth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t think five dollars would be too
much; do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, no. I&#8217;ll willingly give you that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence laid down the coat, thrust his hand into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
his pocket, and then stopped and looked at the clerk,
while a blank look settled on his face. After standing
motionless for a moment, he began with frantic
haste to empty all his pockets. This done he sank
down on the clerk&#8217;s bed, his hands dropped by his
side, and he looked dejected enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it gone?&#8221; asked the clerk, who readily understood
this pantomime.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, it&#8217;s gone&mdash;my pocket-book with an even
hundred dollars in it. Now, am I not in a nice fix?
How am I going to pay my fare to Cairo and back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have dropped out of your pocket when
your horse threw you,&#8221; said the clerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the way it happened, and every cent
I had was in it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clarence looked up and saw that the clerk&#8217;s gaze
was fastened on his watch that lay on the bed; and
that same watch, which was a birth-day present from
his mother, was the boy&#8217;s sole dependence now.
When he was passing through the brier-patch, on his
way to the cellar where his cousin was confined, the
long chain, which dangled from his button-hole, was
constantly catching on the bushes, and Clarence had
unhooked it and put it into his pocket with the watch.
Probably that was all that saved the time-piece, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
had Godfrey Evans seen the chain, he might have
taken that and the watch as well as the money.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose there is any one on board who
will advance me anything on that?&#8221; asked Clarence,
brightening up as if the idea had just occurred to
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking about it,&#8221; replied the clerk.
&#8220;You might try our chief engineer. He&#8217;s always
trading watches when he thinks he can make any
thing by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to sell the watch,&#8221; said Clarence.
&#8220;I only want to borrow some money on it. I shall
return to Rochdale at once, and by the time you
come down again, I shall be ready to redeem it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said the clerk. &#8220;The engineer
is in his room now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s try him at once. Come with me, will
you? You know him better than I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The clerk showed Clarence the way into the engineer&#8217;s
room, where that officer, having just come off
watch, was taking his usual forenoon nap. He
greeted Clarence cordially&mdash;he had smoked more
than one cigar at the boy&#8217;s expense during the down
trip&mdash;and listened patiently to the story he had to
tell. He examined the watch and said he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
advance fifty dollars on it, provided the owner would
be ready to redeem it the next time the Emma Deane
stopped at Rochdale. This Clarence readily promised
to do; so the money was paid at once, the officer pocketed
the watch, and the boy went out feeling as if a
mountain had been removed from his shoulders. He
gave the clerk five dollars for his coat, paid his fare
to Cairo, and still had left a sum of money sufficiently
large to take him home, provided he did not spend
too much for cigars and ale. Half an hour later he
was sitting on the boiler deck with his chair tilted
back, his feet on the railing, a cigar between his
teeth, and looking as happy and contented as
though he had never known a moment&#8217;s trouble in
his life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Things don&#8217;t look quite as dark as they did,&#8221;
said he, throwing back his head and watching the
smoke as it ascended from his cigar. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t lose
anything by making friends of the officers of this boat
on the down trip. Now that I am safely out of the
scrape, I&#8217;d give something to know what is going on
down there at the plantation. Forty thousand
dollars? The last chance I shall ever have to make
a fortune has slipped through my fingers; and all
through Don&#8217;s interference. He deserved just what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
he got, and I hope it will teach him to mind his own
business.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the journey homeward this was the burden
of the boy&#8217;s reflections. He knew that by his conduct
he had destroyed his chance of living on intimate or
even friendly terms with his uncle&#8217;s family, but for
that he cared not; he scarcely even thought of it.
If he had only found the barrel, and received his
share of the contents, he imagined he would have
been supremely happy. He reached home in safety,
and of course his parents were very much surprised
to see him. He told his mother the whole truth,
keeping back nothing, and left her to tell his father.
Mr. Gordon did not have much to say until he had
had time to write to his brother in Mississippi.
What sort of an answer he received to his letter,
Clarence never knew; but one bright morning,
shortly after the letter came, he was ordered to be
ready to start for New York at four o&#8217;clock that
afternoon. Then he knew that his father&#8217;s patience
was all exhausted, and that he was to be placed where
he would be controlled by an iron hand. Entreaties
and promises of better behavior in future were alike
unavailing. To New York he went, and his father
accompanied him. Mr. Gordon came back alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
and the next time anybody heard from Clarence, he
was off the coast of France in the school ship. &#8220;The
officers are awful hard on us,&#8221; wrote Clarence, and
there were volumes in that short sentence. If any
boy desires to find out the full meaning of it for
himself, a voyage across the water and back will
teach him more than he will care to know. Clarence
is in the school ship now; and a letter Mr. Gordon
lately received from the captain, states that a steadier,
more obedient young sailor never lived. Discipline
has worked a great change in him, and it is to be
hoped that he will profit by it when his term of
service expires.</p>

<p>And where was Don all this time? While Clarence
was tossing recklessly about on his bed, alternating
between hope and fear&mdash;hoping that matters
would come out all right after his night&#8217;s exploit,
and fearing that something might happen to defeat
his plans&mdash;Don was passing the time drearily enough
in Godfrey Evans&#8217;s cellar. The position in which
he was confined&mdash;he was standing with his back
against the stanchion&mdash;made it impossible for him to
obtain a wink of sleep, and he spent the long, gloomy
hours in useless struggles to free himself, and in
thinking, not of himself, but of Clarence. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
could his cousin escape the consequences of his rash
act, unless he could free himself from his bonds, and
reach home before his absence was discovered? This
was the question that troubled Don; and whenever
it arose in his mind, he would work desperately to
free one of his hands, knowing that if that much
could be accomplished, he could reach the knife he
carried in his pocket, and in two seconds more the
rope could be cut into inch pieces. But the knots
held, in spite of all his attempts to loosen them, and
Don finally gave up in despair, and waited as patiently
as he could for daylight, telling himself the while
that he had done all he could to save his cousin from
exposure, and now Clarence must look out for himself.</p>

<p>The morning came at last, and Don&#8217;s heart bounded
with hope when he saw the first rays of the sun shining
through the cracks in the door. He was pretty
well tired out by this time, and the cords seemed to
have grown tighter about his ankles. He began
shouting to attract attention as soon as he thought
there was any possibility of making himself heard;
and when he grew tired of that, he set up a shrill
whistle. That startled somebody. It was Godfrey
Evans, who now for the first time became aware that
there was some one besides old Jordan tied up in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
cellar. He recognised the whistle the first time he
heard it, and almost overwhelmed with amazement
and alarm, started off to tell Clarence Gordon of the
astounding discovery he had made.</p>

<p>Don whistled at intervals as long and as loudly
as his breath would permit&mdash;he had grown too hoarse
to shout now&mdash;and at last, when he had become
almost discouraged, he heard hasty steps approaching
the cellar. A moment later something bounded down
the stairs, and Don saw the nose of one of his hounds
thrust under the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carlo!&#8221; he exclaimed, so highly delighted that
he could scarcely speak loud enough to make himself
heard.</p>

<p>The dog whined in answer, and standing on his
hind legs placed his fore feet against the door, which
gave away beneath his weight, and the animal
bounded into the cellar. Don&#8217;s gaze happened to be
directed toward the head of the stairs when this occurred,
and there he saw his brother Bert, stooping
down and looking in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anybody there?&#8221; asked Bert, for it was so dark
he could not see into the cellar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here and find out,&#8221; said Don.</p>

<p>Bert uttered an ejaculation of astonishment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
came down the steps in two jumps. All he could see
when he entered was the white coat Don wore, but
he recognised the voice as he had recognised the
whistle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut the rope first,&#8221; exclaimed Don, &#8220;and afterward
ask as many questions as you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The rope?&#8221; repeated Bert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Come nearer and you will see that I am
wrapped up in a plough-line.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bert was profoundly astonished, but he wisely refrained
from making any inquiries. His knife was
out in an instant, and a few passes with the blade
liberated Don, who made a feeble attempt to walk
and fell forward into his brother&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be uneasy,&#8221; said Don, who knew by the
exclamation his brother uttered that he was greatly
alarmed. &#8220;I&#8217;m all right, only I feel as if I had the
rheumatism. I&#8217;ve been tied up there ever since nine
o&#8217;clock last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Don!&#8221; cried Bert. &#8220;Who put you there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I tell you, will you promise not to say a word
about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Bert, quickly. &#8220;No one
shall treat you so and then go off scot-free if I can&mdash;Why,
Don, what in the world&mdash;I mean how&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>Bert had by this time assisted his brother to the
door where he had a fair view of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that if I am your brother, I have
changed into a black man during the last few hours,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221; said Don, laughing heartily at the expression
of astonishment on Bert&#8217;s face. &#8220;In me
you behold&mdash;by the way, you don&#8217;t remember old
Jordan, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I do not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am he; the identical old nigger!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don,&#8221; said Bert, reproachfully, &#8220;you didn&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did,&#8221; replied Don, as he sat down on the
lowest step and stretched his arms and legs. &#8220;I am
the one who cut up all those shines at the barn, and
made the hands think old Jordan had risen from the
dead. I am sorry now, but the temptation was so
strong I couldn&#8217;t resist it. But didn&#8217;t I scare everybody,
though?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Don,&#8221; said Bert, who could not understand
the matter at all, &#8220;how came&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you want to find out,&#8221; said his
brother, &#8220;and &#8216;thereby hangs a tale&#8217;&mdash;a long one,
too. I&#8217;ll tell it while I am resting.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this introduction Don began and told a story
that made Bert open his eyes wider than ever. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
related as much of the history of the buried treasure
as he had been able to learn, told how he had first
found out about it, and gave a glowing description
of the plans he had formed to frighten the two conspirators,
as he called them. He described minutely
all the incidents connected with his capture and confinement
in the cellar, and when he told of the
coolness and determination with which Clarence had
conducted the whole proceeding, Bert&#8217;s astonishment
was almost unbounded.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a joke that was <i>no</i> joke,&#8221; said Don,
in conclusion. &#8220;The tables were turned on me in a
way that would have amused me greatly, had it not
been for the fact that I knew Clarence was likely to
suffer for what he had done. I didn&#8217;t care for myself,
although I assure you there was no fun in being
tied up for almost twelve hours. Where is Clarence
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I left him at the barn, waiting for your horse to
be saddled, so that he could start out in search of
you. Godfrey was there too, and I heard him
promise father that he would look through the woods
and see if he could discover any signs of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did either of them know that they had captured
me instead of old Jordan?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>&#8220;I heard nothing to indicate the fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did the folks have to say about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bert replied that the folks had had a good deal to
say about it, and suggested that if his brother was
able to walk to the fence where the pony was hitched
they had better start for home at once. The sooner
Don got there, the sooner would the anxiety of his
mother and sisters be relieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I must face the music some time,&#8221; said
Don, resignedly, &#8220;and I suppose I might as well do
it now as an hour later. But I can&#8217;t go home in
this shape. Help me down to the lake so that I can
wash the black off my hands and face.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a matter of no little difficulty for Don to
walk so far; but, by Bert&#8217;s assistance, he reached
the shore of the lake at last, and having taken a
long and hearty drink of the water, and washed off
the blacking, he felt better. It was while he was
thus engaged that Clarence visited the cellar.</p>

<p>After Don had rested a few minutes and refreshed
himself with another drink of water, Bert brought
up his pony, and his brother managed to climb into
the saddle. Bert walked by the pony&#8217;s side, and of
course had a multitude of questions to ask about things
which Don had not thought to mention in his story.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
Now, that his surprise and indignation had somewhat
abated, he could laugh heartily at his brother&#8217;s
description of his adventures. They met no one
while they were on the way home, and Don was glad
to find that there was nobody about the barn. He
hurried into old Jordan&#8217;s room, and when he had put
on his own clothes, Bert helped him into the house.
His mother and sisters met him at the door, and
greeted him as though they had not seen him for a
year or more. An explanation was at once demanded,
but as Marshall was present, Don gave it to his
mother in her own room. About the time he finished
his father came in, and then the story had to be told
over again. Of course the general and his wife were
greatly amazed, and they were troubled and perplexed,
too. They were troubled because they had expected
better things than this of Clarence, and perplexed
because they did not know just what ought to be done
now. It was plain that Clarence was not a fit associate
for any decent boy, and the sooner he was at
home, where he belonged, the better it would be for
him and Don, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did they say about it?&#8221; asked Bert, as
soon as he had a chance to speak to his brother privately.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t say much,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;Clarence
must go home, and that I think will end the
matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he is on his way home already,&#8221; said
Bert. &#8220;I know I should start at once if I were in
his place. I couldn&#8217;t face anybody after an act like
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is because you have never been guilty of
a mean act in your life,&#8221; said Don. &#8220;One gets
hardened to such things after a while. I know it by
my experience at school. Probably Clarence has
been in more scrapes than you and I ever dreamed
of.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was not only very probable, but very true;
but still he was not sufficiently hardened to face the
consequences of this, which was one of the worst
scrapes he had ever been in.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Don&#8217;s pony came home riderless.
The hostler told the general that he came
from toward the landing, and that he had seen Clarence
going that way a short time before. Upon
hearing this, the general set out at once for Rochdale,
where he learned from some of the hangers-on
that his nephew had been seen to board the Emma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
Deane, and as he had not come off again he must
have gone up the river on her. This being the case,
there was nothing to be done now but to communicate
with his father and await developments.</p>

<p>A few weeks cleared up everything. Clarence
had reached his father&#8217;s house in safety, and the
same letter that brought the information, contained
also a sum of money sufficient to defray Marshall&#8217;s
expenses to his home. The boy seemed glad to go,
and his cousins rarely heard from him afterward.</p>

<p>And what did the general say to Don? Not a
word. The latter limped about the house for nearly
a week before he was able to sit in the saddle again,
and his father wisely concluded that if his night&#8217;s
experience in the cellar had not cured him of his
love of practical joking, nothing that he could say
would help the matter any. Of course, both the
boys were eager to learn the truth concerning the
buried treasure, and as soon as Marshall went away,
they spoke to their parents about it. Then it came
out that either old Jordan had wilfully misrepresented
things, which was probable, or else that Godfrey&#8217;s
lively imagination and his great desire to be
rich without labor, had led him to magnify the contents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
of the barrel, which was still more probable.
The old negro had certainly buried a barrel on the
morning the levee was cut, and it contained silver-ware
that, in good times, could have been bought for
a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars. The barrel
was dug up by another negro as soon as the soldiers
were gone, and the most of the silver-ware was in
use now, and had been ever since the war. The
general thought this a good place to say something
the boys would remember. People do sometimes
get rich without labor, he said, but their wealth does
not, as a rule, last long. To learn the value of
money, one must work for it. There is but one sure
way to become prosperous, and that is to be industrious,
saving and honest. Had Godfrey remembered
this, he might have been living at home, a
happy and contented man, instead of hiding in the
swamp for fear of arrest. The general never thought
of having him arrested, and would not have said a
word to him if he had met him in the road; but
Godfrey knew something that the general didn&#8217;t
know: he had been guilty of highway robbery, and
he thought it best to keep out of sight. Of course,
he went on from bad to worse&mdash;one always does,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
unless he grows better every day&mdash;and the people in
the neighborhood often heard of him after that.
Perhaps we also shall hear of him, and of some of our
other characters, in the second volume of this series,
which will be entitled, <span class="smcap">The Boy Trapper</span>.</p>

<h3>HORATIO ALGER, JR.</h3>

<p>The enormous sales of the books of Horatio Alger, Jr.,
show the greatness of his popularity among the boys, and
prove that he is one of their most favored writers. I am told
that more than half a million copies altogether have been
sold, and that all the large circulating libraries in the country
have several complete sets, of which only two or three volumes
are ever on the shelves at one time. If this is true,
what thousands and thousands of boys have read and are
reading Mr. Alger&#8217;s books! His peculiar style of stories,
often imitated but never equaled, have taken a hold upon the
young people, and, despite their similarity, are eagerly read
as soon as they appear.</p>

<p>Mr. Alger became famous with the publication of that
undying book, &#8220;Ragged Dick, or Street Life in New York.&#8221;
It was his first book for young people, and its success was so
great that he immediately devoted himself to that kind of
writing. It was a new and fertile field for a writer then, and
Mr. Alger&#8217;s treatment of it at once caught the fancy of the
boys. &#8220;Ragged Dick&#8221; first appeared in 1868, and ever since
then it has been selling steadily, until now it is estimated
that about 200,000 copies of the series have been sold.</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;<i>Pleasant Hours for Boys and Girls.</i></p>



<p>A writer for boys should have an abundant sympathy
with them. He should be able to enter into their plans,
hopes, and aspirations. He should learn to look upon life
as they do. Boys object to be written down to. A boy&#8217;s
heart opens to the man or writer who understands him.</p>

<h3>HARRY CASTLEMON.</h3>

<p class="center">HOW I CAME TO WRITE MY FIRST BOOK.</p>


<p>When I was sixteen years old I belonged to a composition
class. It was our custom to go on the recitation seat
every day with clean slates, and we were allowed ten minutes
to write seventy words on any subject the teacher
thought suited to our capacity. One day he gave out &#8220;What
a Man Would See if He Went to Greenland.&#8221; My heart was
in the matter, and before the ten minutes were up I had one
side of my slate filled. The teacher listened to the reading
of our compositions, and when they were all over he simply
said: &#8220;Some of you will make your living by writing one
of these days.&#8221; That gave me something to ponder upon
I did not say so out loud, but I knew that my composition
was as good as the best of them. By the way, there was
another thing that came in my way just then. I was reading
at that time one of Mayne Reid&#8217;s works which I had
drawn from the library, and I pondered upon it as much as
I did upon what the teacher said to me. In introducing
Swartboy to his readers he made use of this expression:
&#8220;No visible change was observable in Swartboy&#8217;s countenance.&#8221;
Now, it occurred to me that if a man of his education
could make such a blunder as that and still write a
book, I ought to be able to do it, too. I went home that very
day and began a story, &#8220;The Old Guide&#8217;s Narrative,&#8221; which
was sent to the <i>New York Weekly</i>, and came back, respectfully
declined. It was written on both sides of the sheets
but I didn&#8217;t know that this was against the rules. Nothing
abashed, I began another, and receiving some instruction,
from a friend of mine who was a clerk in a book store, I
wrote it on only one side of the paper. But mind you, he
didn&#8217;t know what I was doing. Nobody knew it; but one
day, after a hard Saturday&#8217;s work&mdash;the other boys had been
out skating on the brick-pond&mdash;I shyly broached the subject
to my mother. I felt the need of some sympathy. She
listened in amazement, and then said: &#8220;Why, do you think
you could write a book like that?&#8221; That settled the matter,
and from that day no one knew what I was up to until I sent
the first four volumes of Gunboat Series to my father. Was
it work? Well, yes; it was hard work, but each week I had
the satisfaction of seeing the manuscript grow until the
&#8220;Young Naturalist&#8221; was all complete.</p>

<h3>EDWARD S. ELLIS.</h3>


<p>Edward S. Ellis, the popular writer of boys&#8217; books, is
a native of Ohio, where he was born somewhat more than a
half-century ago. His father was a famous hunter and rifle
shot, and it was doubtless his exploits and those of his associates,
with their tales of adventure which gave the son his
taste for the breezy backwoods and for depicting the stirring
life of the early settlers on the frontier.</p>

<p>Mr. Ellis began writing at an early age and his work was
acceptable from the first. His parents removed to New
Jersey while he was a boy and he was graduated from the
State Normal School and became a member of the faculty
while still in his teens. He was afterward principal of the
Trenton High School, a trustee and then superintendent of
schools. By that time his services as a writer had become
so pronounced that he gave his entire attention to literature.
He was an exceptionally successful teacher and wrote a number
of text-books for schools, all of which met with high
favor. For these and his historical productions, Princeton
College conferred upon him the degree of Master of Arts.</p>

<p>The high moral character, the clean, manly tendencies
and the admirable literary style of Mr. Ellis&#8217; stories have
made him as popular on the other side of the Atlantic as in
this country. A leading paper remarked some time since,
that no mother need hesitate to place in the hands of her boy
any book written by Mr. Ellis. They are found in the leading
Sunday-school libraries, where, as may well be believed,
they are in wide demand and do much good by their sound,
wholesome lessons which render them as acceptable to parents
as to their children. All of his books published by Henry
T. Coates &amp; Co. are re-issued in London, and many have
been translated into other languages. Mr. Ellis is a writer
of varied accomplishments, and, in addition to his stones, is
the author of historical works, of a number of pieces of popular
music and has made several valuable inventions. Mr.
Ellis is in the prime of his mental and physical powers, and
great as have been the merits of his past achievements, there
is reason to look for more brilliant productions from his pen
in the near future.</p>

<h3>J. T. TROWBRIDGE.</h3>


<p>Neither as a writer does he stand apart from the great
currents of life and select some exceptional phase or odd
combination of circumstances. He stands on the common
level and appeals to the universal heart, and all that he suggests
or achieves is on the plane and in the line of march of
the great body of humanity.</p>

<p>The Jack Hazard series of stories, published in the late
<i>Our Young Folks</i>, and continued in the first volume of <i>St.
Nicholas</i>, under the title of &#8220;Fast Friends,&#8221; is no doubt
destined to hold a high place in this class of literature. The
delight of the boys in them (and of their seniors, too) is
well founded. They go to the right spot every time. Trowbridge
knows the heart of a boy like a book, and the heart
of a man, too, and he has laid them both open in these books
in a most successful manner. Apart from the qualities that
render the series so attractive to all young readers, they
have great value on account of their portraitures of American
country life and character. The drawing is wonderfully
accurate, and as spirited as it is true. The constable, Sellick,
is an original character, and as minor figures where will
we find anything better than Miss Wansey, and Mr. P. Pipkin,
Esq. The picture of Mr. Dink&#8217;s school, too, is capital,
and where else in fiction is there a better nick-name than
that the boys gave to poor little Stephen Treadwell, &#8220;Step
Hen,&#8221; as he himself pronounced his name in an unfortunate
moment when he saw it in print for the first time in his lesson
in school.</p>

<p>On the whole, these books are very satisfactory, and
afford the critical reader the rare pleasure of the works that
are just adequate, that easily fulfill themselves and accomplish
all they set out to do.&mdash;<i>Scribner&#8217;s Monthly.</i></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
